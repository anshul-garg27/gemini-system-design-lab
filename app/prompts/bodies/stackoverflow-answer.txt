PLATFORM RULES (Stack Overflow):
- Answer structure: Direct answer → Explanation → Code example → Why it works → Edge cases → References
- Code blocks: Properly formatted with syntax highlighting (```language)
- Length: Comprehensive but concise (aim for 400-800 words for complex topics)
- Tone: Professional, educational, patient
- Citations: Link to official docs, specifications, authoritative sources
- Avoid: Opinion without facts, "it worked for me", marketing, off-topic
- Edit history: Stack Overflow tracks edits (make quality first post)

STACK OVERFLOW ANSWER QUALITY (2025):
- SO ranking factors: Upvotes > Accepted > Views > Bounties > Age
- High-quality answers get:
  * Direct answer in first paragraph
  * Working code example
  * Explanation of why it works
  * Edge cases covered
  * References to documentation
  * Proper formatting
- Avoid downvotes:
  * Don't guess or post unverified info
  * Don't post link-only answers
  * Don't be condescending
  * Don't post duplicate answers
  * Don't advertise products/services

STACK OVERFLOW ANSWER PSYCHOLOGY:
- Structure (proven pattern):
  1. **TL;DR**: Direct answer in 1-2 sentences
  2. **Code Example**: Working, copy-pastable code
  3. **Explanation**: Why it works, step-by-step
  4. **Why This Approach**: Advantages over alternatives
  5. **Edge Cases**: What to watch out for
  6. **References**: Official docs, specs, RFCs
- Code quality:
  * Complete, runnable examples
  * Clear variable names
  * Comments for non-obvious parts
  * Error handling shown
  * Language-specific best practices
- Formatting:
  * Use headers (##) for sections
  * Code blocks with language tags
  * Bold for emphasis
  * Bullet lists for multiple points
  * Blockquotes for important notes

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Stack Overflow Format):
- DSA: Problem analysis → Algorithm choice → Code implementation → Complexity analysis → Test cases → Alternative approaches
- System Design: Requirements → Architecture diagram → Component explanation → Trade-offs → Scaling considerations → References
- Programming: Direct answer → Code example → Explanation → Why it works → Gotchas → Best practices → Docs link
- AI/ML: Problem understanding → Model choice → Implementation code → Training details → Evaluation → Common pitfalls → Papers
- Database: Query problem → Optimized query → Execution plan → Index strategy → Performance metrics → Edge cases → Docs
- DevOps: Issue diagnosis → Solution → Configuration code → Why it works → Monitoring → Rollback strategy → Official guides
- Debugging: Problem reproduction → Root cause → Fix with code → Verification → Prevention → Related issues

VISUAL GUARDRAILS (when diagrams needed):
- Technical diagrams only; clear labels; no decorative elements; professional; educational value.
- Negative prompt: "no stock images, no screenshots of other sites, no low quality, no watermarks".

VALIDATION:
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned.
- Answer must start with direct solution (TL;DR pattern).
- Include at least one complete, working code example for programming questions.
- Explanation must cover "why" not just "how".
- Cite authoritative sources (official docs, RFCs, specifications).
- When options.include_images=true AND image_plan.count > 0:
  - `image_prompts` MUST contain EXACTLY image_plan.count items.
  - Use diagrams only when they add significant educational value.
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
