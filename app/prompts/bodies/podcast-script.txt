PLATFORM RULES (Podcast):
- Episode length: 15-45 minutes (standard), adjust based on topic complexity
- Script structure: Intro → Hook → Main content (segments) → Recap → Outro → CTA
- Speaking style: Conversational, avoid reading verbatim, natural pauses
- Audio cues: [pause], [music fade], [sound effect], [transition]
- Timestamps: Include for show notes
- Resources: Links mentioned for show notes
- Call to action: Subscribe, rate, review, visit link

PODCAST SCRIPT BEST PRACTICES (2025):
- Opening (first 60 seconds critical):
  * Cold open with hook (surprising fact, story, question)
  * Brief intro music (5-10 seconds)
  * Welcome + episode topic
  * What listener will learn
- Main content:
  * 3-5 clear segments
  * Smooth transitions between segments
  * Personal stories or examples
  * Vary pacing (fast facts, slow explanations)
  * Audio-friendly explanations (no "as you can see")
- Engagement:
  * Rhetorical questions to listener
  * Relatable analogies
  * Occasional humor
  * Preview what's coming next
- Closing:
  * Quick recap of key points
  * Clear CTA (subscribe, rate, visit link)
  * Tease next episode
  * Outro music

PODCAST CONTENT PSYCHOLOGY:
- Audio-first considerations:
  * No visual references ("this chart" → "imagine a chart")
  * Spell out acronyms first time
  * Use vivid language for mental pictures
  * Repeat key points for retention
- Pacing:
  * Vary sentence length
  * Natural pauses for emphasis
  * Speed up for excitement, slow for complexity
  * Use voice inflection (noted in script)
- Storytelling:
  * Start with hook/story
  * Use "you" to make personal
  * Real-world examples
  * Build tension and resolution
- Technical content:
  * Break complex concepts into steps
  * Use analogies for difficult topics
  * Summarize before moving on
  * Provide context before diving deep

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Podcast Format):
- DSA: Problem story → Why it matters → Algorithm explanation → Code walkthrough (spoken) → Complexity → Real-world use → Practice tips
- System Design: Scale challenge story → Architecture overview → Component deep-dive → Trade-offs → Real company example → Lessons → Resources
- Programming: Bug story → Concept explanation → Solution walkthrough → Best practices → Common pitfalls → Tips → Resources
- AI/ML: Surprising result story → Model explanation → Training process → Evaluation → Production tips → Pitfalls → Tools
- Database: Performance problem → Analysis → Optimization strategy → Implementation → Results → Best practices → Resources
- DevOps: Incident story → Resolution → Automation approach → Monitoring → Prevention → Lessons → Tools
- Career: Interview story → Preparation approach → Key lessons → Common mistakes → Action plan → Resources

VISUAL GUARDRAILS (image prompts):
- Podcast cover: 3000×3000, 1:1 ratio, readable at thumbnail size; vibrant but professional; text minimal.
- Episode thumbnail: Optional, shows episode topic visually.
- Negative prompt: "no cluttered design, no tiny text, no low contrast, no stock photos".
