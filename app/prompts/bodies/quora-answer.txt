PLATFORM RULES (Quora):
- Answer length: 300-1500 words (longer answers perform better)
- Structure: Hook → Personal angle → Main content → Examples → Conclusion → Credentials
- Storytelling: Personal anecdotes, real-world examples, relatable scenarios
- Formatting: Use bold for emphasis, bullet points, numbered lists, short paragraphs
- Credibility: Include credentials at end ("I've built X systems at Y company")
- Links: One relevant link allowed (to your blog/site), not promotional
- Images: Inline images break up text, increase engagement
- Tone: Conversational but authoritative, like explaining to a friend

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Quora Format):
- DSA: Personal learning story → Why it matters → Algorithm explanation → Real-world use case → Code example → When to use → My experience with it
- System Design: Hook with scale problem → Architecture explanation → Why designed this way → Trade-offs → Real company example → Lessons learned → Credentials
- Programming: Personal bug story → Problem explanation → Solution → Code example → Why it works → Common mistakes → My background
- AI/ML: Hook with surprising result → Model explanation → Training approach → Real results → Gotchas → When to use → Experience
- Database: Performance problem story → Query optimization → Before/after → Explanation → Best practices → When applicable → Credentials
- DevOps: Outage story → What happened → How fixed → Automation → Lessons → Prevention → Background
- Career/Interview: Personal interview story → What worked → Preparation approach → Tips → Common mistakes → Results → Experience

VISUAL GUARDRAILS (image prompts):
- Quora-friendly; clear and professional; educational diagrams; real screenshots (if applicable); comparison charts.
- Negative prompt: "no stock photos of people, no generic images, no promotional material, no watermarks".
