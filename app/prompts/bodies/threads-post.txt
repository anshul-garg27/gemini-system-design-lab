# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (THREADS POST):
⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST generate 2-4 SQUARE IMAGES (1:1 ratio, 1080x1080). This is NOT optional.

CORE IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - MANDATORY):
1. "square_a" - Insight card with bold headline + metric
2. "square_b" - Visual element (checklist/diagram/quote)

OPTIONAL IMAGES (Add 3-4 for richer posts):
3. "stat_card" - Metrics panel with hero number
4. "pattern_bg" - Abstract background for text overlay

TOTAL IMAGES: 2-4 square images (1:1 ratio, 1080x1080) - Threads mobile feed optimized

INPUT VARIABLES (provided by caller):
- topic_id: "{topic_id}"
- topic_title: "{topic_name}"
- topic_description: """{topic_description}"""
- audience: "{audience}"
- tone: "{tone}"
- locale: "{locale}"
- primary_url: "{primary_url}"
- brand: {
    "site_url":"{primary_url}",
    "handles":{"instagram":"@systemdesign","x":"@systemdesign","linkedin":"@systemdesign","youtube":"@systemdesign","github":"@systemdesign"},
    "utm_base":"utm_source=threads&utm_medium=post"
  }
- options: { "include_images": true, "max_length_levels":"standard", "variance_seed":"default", "length_hint": 0 }

# OPTIONAL — SEO (auto-correct allowed; set keyword_overrides=true if corrected)
- seo: { "primary_keywords": [], "secondary_keywords": [], "lsi_terms": [] }

# NEW (optional) — multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 2,                                      # default 2; allowed 2–4
    "roles": ["square_a","square_b","stat_card","pattern_bg"],
    "ratio": "1:1",
    "size_px": "1080x1080",
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C..)."
  }

# NEW — topic-agnostic taxonomy (for hashtags & phrasing)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate tags:
   broad(2–3), niche(2–3), micro_niche(2–3), intent(1–2), branded(0–1).
   Localize to {locale} when natural. Lowercase; no spaces."

PLATFORM RULES (Threads Post):
- Main post: 1–3 sentences; ≤500 characters; warm, conversational tone; tasteful emojis (1–3).
- Reply chain: 2–4 additional posts **if needed**; each ≤500 characters; one idea per reply.
- Hashtags: 5–10 **casual** tags overall; distribute 0–2 per post; keep them short and human.
- Mentions: propose 1–3 relevant accounts overall; use ≤1 mention per post (optional).
- Link: if {primary_url} present, include exactly one tracked link in the **last** post (or main post if single): "{primary_url}?{brand.utm_base}". If empty → omit links.
- Images: if enabled, return 2 square prompts by default (A/B). If `image_plan.count` > 2, add roles in order: stat_card, pattern_bg.

THREADS ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025 - CRITICAL):
- Threads prioritizes: **REPLIES > Likes > Reposts** (conversation-first algorithm)
- **Reply rate CRITICAL**: High reply rate = pushed to "For You" feed + notifications to followers
- **Target metrics**: 3%+ reply rate (vs <1% typical), 8%+ total engagement, 1000+ impressions
- **Hook decisive**: First 100 characters decide if users engage ("read more" threshold)
- **Best posting times**: Tuesday-Thursday 10AM-12PM or 5-7PM ET (Meta peak engagement hours)
- **Thread chains**: Multi-post threads get 2-3x more engagement than single posts
- **Authenticity wins**: Threads heavily favors genuine conversation over promotional/sales content
- **Question posts**: 3x more replies than statement posts (ask = engagement gold)
- **Vulnerability = engagement**: Personal stories ("Here's what I learned...") outperform how-tos
- **Hashtags**: 5-10 max, casual lowercase style (#systemdesign not #SystemDesign)
- **Images**: Square (1:1) format optimized for mobile feed, 2-4 images ideal
- **Creator replies**: Replying to comments = algorithm boost + more distribution
- **Mobile-first**: 90%+ Threads usage on mobile, optimize for thumb scrolling
- **Conversation starters**: "What's your approach?" "Anyone else?" = reply drivers
- **No links penalty**: Unlike Twitter, Threads doesn't suppress posts with links
- **First hour critical**: 5-10 replies in first hour = viral trajectory activated

# 🎯 THREADS POST PSYCHOLOGY (REPLY-OPTIMIZED - 7 HOOK FORMULAS):

**HOOK FORMULA 1 - Question (3x Reply Rate):**
- Format: "[Relatable challenge question] 🤔"
- Examples: "How do you handle 1M QPS without breaking the bank?", "What's your go-to algorithm for range queries?", "Anyone else struggle with distributed transactions?"
- Why it works: Direct question = brain wants to answer, Threads pushes questioned posts to "For You"
- Reply trigger: Question mark at end = clear invitation

**HOOK FORMULA 2 - Learning Share (Vulnerability = Engagement):**
- Format: "Spent [timeframe] [doing X]. Here's what actually worked..."
- Examples: "Spent 3 months optimizing Redis. Here's what actually worked...", "6 failed interviews taught me this pattern...", "Rebuilt our architecture 4 times. Key lessons..."
- Why it works: Vulnerability = relatability, "actually worked" promises practical value
- Reply trigger: Implied story continuation creates "read more" curiosity

**HOOK FORMULA 3 - Mistake Reveal (Most Relatable):**
- Format: "I thought [wrong assumption]. I was SO wrong. 😅"
- Examples: "I thought O(n) was good enough. I was SO wrong.", "Assumed microservices = automatic scale. Narrator: They didn't.", "Ignored indexing for months. Cost us $10K."
- Why it works: Mistakes = most relatable content, emoji softens vulnerability
- Reply trigger: Others want to share their mistakes too ("Me too!" effect)

**HOOK FORMULA 4 - Contrarian (Polarizing = Engagement):**
- Format: "Hot take: [Unpopular opinion]. Here's why..."
- Examples: "Hot take: Microservices are overrated for most teams.", "Unpopular opinion: You don't need Kubernetes.", "NoSQL isn't always the answer. Fight me."
- Why it works: Mild controversy = people want to agree/disagree in replies
- Reply trigger: Invites debate (both supporters and challengers reply)

**HOOK FORMULA 5 - Result Tease (Curiosity Gap):**
- Format: "[Impressive result with numbers]. The trick? 👇"
- Examples: "Cut latency from 500ms to 5ms. The trick?", "Scaled to 1M users on $500/mo. How?", "Reduced deploy time from 2hrs to 5min. The secret?"
- Why it works: Curiosity gap + specific numbers = must know more
- Reply trigger: Thread continuation expected, people want to share their results

**HOOK FORMULA 6 - Personal Story (Authenticity Wins):**
- Format: "[Failed/struggled X times] before [learning Y]. Sharing so you don't have to..."
- Examples: "Failed 5 FAANG interviews before learning this pattern.", "Took 3 production outages to understand this.", "Burned $20K on wrong architecture. Here's what I'd do now..."
- Why it works: Human journey = emotional connection, sacrifice = value perception
- Reply trigger: Others want to share their journeys ("Happened to me too!")

**HOOK FORMULA 7 - Quick Insight (Value-First):**
- Format: "[Technology/Pattern] changed how I [outcome]. Quick thread 🧵"
- Examples: "Caching strategy changed how I build systems. Quick thread.", "This Python feature changed how I code. 30 seconds.", "Database sharding pattern. What they don't tell you..."
- Why it works: Promise of quick value = low commitment, high reward
- Reply trigger: "Quick" lowers barrier, people ask follow-up questions

## REPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE (2-4 Posts - 2-3x Engagement Boost):

**Reply 1 (Context/Problem):**
- Goal: Build curiosity, establish pain point
- Format: "[Problem description with relatable detail]. [Concrete cost/impact]. [Transition to solution]"
- Length: 200-350 chars
- Emojis: 0-1 (keep professional casual)
- End with: Tease solution ("Then I discovered...")

**Reply 2 (Solution/Insight - Value Delivery):**
- Goal: Deliver core value, satisfy curiosity
- Format: "[Solution approach]. [Key mechanism]. [Concrete example/metric]"
- Length: 250-400 chars
- Hashtags: 1-2 relevant technical tags
- End with: "But..." (tease trade-off/caveat)

**Reply 3 (Trade-Off/Caveat - Build Trust):**
- Goal: Show expertise through nuance, avoid silver bullet claims
- Format: "[Trade-off or limitation]. [When it works / when it doesn't]. [Your recommendation]"
- Length: 200-350 chars
- End with: Question ("What's your experience?" or "Anyone tried this?")

**Reply 4 (Optional - CTA + Link):**
- Goal: Drive action, link placement
- Format: "[Summary line]. [Clear CTA]. [Link if primary_url present]"
- Length: 150-250 chars
- Hashtags: 1-2
- CTA: "Want more? Link in bio" or "Full guide: [link]"

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS (REPLY-OPTIMIZED):

**Conversation Starters (End 50%+ Posts With These):**
- "What's your approach?"
- "Anyone else deal with this?"
- "Curious what you think..."
- "What would you do differently?"
- "Have you tried this?"
- "Change my mind 😄"

**Reply-Driving Elements:**
- ✅ End with question (3x reply rate)
- ✅ Leave intentional gaps ("DM me for details" = people ask in replies instead)
- ✅ "Agree or disagree?" (binary choice = easy reply)
- ✅ Tag pattern: "👇 Drop your [tech stack/approach/experience]"
- ✅ Polls: "A or B?" in main text (if no native poll feature)
- ✅ Vulnerability: Admitting mistakes/struggles = "me too" replies

**Emoji Strategy (Casual Not Corporate):**
- Use: 1-3 per post total
- Friendly: 🤔 😅 👇 🧵 💡 ⚡ 🔥 (conversational)
- Avoid: 🚀 💪 🎯 📈 (too corporate/motivational)
- Placement: Mid-sentence for emphasis or end for tone

**Authenticity Signals (Threads Favors These):**
- Personal pronouns ("I thought", "We tried", "My team")
- Specific numbers (not round: "$487/mo" better than "$500/mo")
- Real company names ("At Uber" if true, otherwise "At a Series B startup")
- Time markers ("After 3 months", "Last Tuesday", "6 failed attempts")
- Honest caveats ("This won't work if...", "Only worth it when...")

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Threads Format):
- DSA/Algorithms: "Just realized [algorithm] can be O(n log n) instead of O(n²). Mind. Blown. 🤯"
- System Design: "Your architecture might not need [complex solution]. Here's a simpler approach..."
- Programming: "This [language] feature changed how I code. Quick thread 🧵"
- AI/ML: "Training a model? Here's what they don't tell you about [hyperparameter]..."
- Database: "Your slow queries might not need more indexes. Try this instead..."
- DevOps: "Deployment taking forever? Here's the bottleneck you're missing..."
- Interview Prep: "Failed [X] interviews before learning this. Sharing so you don't have to..."

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (Square 1:1 Threads Images):
