VALIDATION:
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned.
- Cover image is REQUIRED (Daily.dev needs it for social cards).
- Title must be 50-70 characters (SEO + readability).
- Meta description must be 140-160 characters.
- Include code examples for technical topics.
- TL;DR section with key takeaways.
- 3-5 relevant tags from Daily.dev taxonomy.
- When options.include_images=true:
  - If `image_plan.count` provided → `image_prompts` MUST contain EXACTLY that many items.
  - Minimum is 1 (cover_image is required).
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
