PLATFORM RULES (Hacker News):
- Title: concise, factual, specific; ≤80 chars; no clickbait, no emojis, no Bracketed prefixes (except "Show HN:").
- Link policy:
  * If sharing external content, use a **naked canonical URL** (no UTM/tracking).
  * If Show HN (or discussion only), prefer a **text post**; include demo/repo links in body text post (also without tracking).
- Summary: 2–3 neutral sentences; include one concrete fact/number if available.
- Show HN: explain what it is, what it does, why interesting, what feedback you want; list known limitations.
- Prepare technical details for comments: stack, metrics, license, alternatives, roadmap, security/privacy.

HACKER NEWS ALGORITHM & COMMUNITY CULTURE (2025):
- HN ranking: (upvotes - 1) / (age in hours + 2)^gravity (gravity=1.8)
- First hour CRITICAL: 5-10 upvotes in first hour = front page potential
- Voting ring detection: Avoid asking for upvotes (instant flagged)
- Title quality: Specific > vague, factual > clickbait
- Submission time: Weekdays 8-11AM PT or 2-4PM PT = peak activity
- Comment engagement: OP responding thoughtfully = more visibility
- Domain reputation: First-time domains may get less initial visibility
- Flag/vouch system: Quality content gets vouched, spam gets flagged
- Show HN: Separate queue, gets 2nd chance if initially missed
- Duplicate detection: Posting same URL again within 6 months = hidden
- Penalty: Breaking guidelines = account/domain penalty

HACKER NEWS TITLE PSYCHOLOGY:
- Effective title patterns (≤80 chars):
  * Technical: "How We Scaled Redis to Handle 1M QPS on a Single Instance"
  * Implementation: "Building a Distributed Cache with Consistent Hashing in Go"
  * Analysis: "Why Database Indexes Can Make Queries Slower (Not Faster)"
  * Discovery: "I Found a 10x Performance Bug in Python's asyncio"
  * Show HN: "Show HN: Open-source tool to visualize system architecture from code"
  * Comparison: "Benchmarking 5 Message Queues at 100K Messages/Sec"
  * Postmortem: "Our 6-Hour Outage: What We Learned About Database Failover"
- What works:
  * Specific numbers (1M QPS, 10x, 99.9%)
  * Concrete technologies (Redis, Go, PostgreSQL)
  * Real problems solved
  * Surprising insights
  * Open source
  * Technical depth
- What gets flagged:
  * Marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
  * Clickbait ("you won't believe")
  * Vague titles ("interesting approach")
  * Self-promotion without disclosure
  * Paywalls (instant downvote)

SHOW HN BEST PRACTICES:
- What to include:
  * Clear description of what it does
  * Concrete use case
  * Technical stack
  * Demo link (working, fast)
  * Source code (if open)
  * Known limitations (shows honesty)
  * What feedback you want
- First comment should have:
  * Longer explanation
  * Why you built it
  * Interesting technical challenges
  * Architecture decisions
  * Performance numbers
  * Comparison to alternatives
  * Roadmap
- Be present:
  * Reply to questions quickly
  * Be technical, not defensive
  * Share code/benchmarks
  * Acknowledge limitations
  * Thank people for feedback

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (HN Style):
- DSA: "Algorithm X achieves O(n log n) for problem Y (previously O(n²))" + detailed explanation of optimization + complexity proof + benchmarks
- System Design: "How [Company] scaled [system] to [big number] with [specific tech]" + architecture diagram + numbers + trade-offs + lessons learned
- Programming: "[Language] feature that solved [specific problem]" + code example + benchmarks + gotchas + when not to use
- AI/ML: "Training [model] to [accuracy]% in [time] using [technique]" + methodology + results + dataset + hyperparameters + ablation studies
- Database: "Optimizing [database] queries from [slow] to [fast]" + query + explain plan + metrics + indexing strategy + trade-offs
- DevOps: "Reducing deployment time from [before] to [after] with [tool]" + implementation + results + monitoring + rollback strategy
- Interview Prep: "[Company] interview question: [problem]" + approach + solution + complexity + variations + tips
- Show HN: "Show HN: [Tool name] - [what it does in 5 words]" + demo + technical details + limitations + roadmap

HACKER NEWS COMMENT STRATEGY:
- First comment (by OP) should include:
  * Longer technical explanation
  * Architecture decisions with rationale
  * Performance numbers (p50/p95/p99)
  * Code snippets or GitHub links
  * Known limitations (shows honesty)
  * Comparison to alternatives
  * Roadmap/future work
- Responding to comments:
  * Be technical, not defensive
  * Share actual data/benchmarks
  * Acknowledge valid criticisms
  * Explain trade-offs made
  * Link to source code
  * Thank constructive feedback
- Red flags to avoid:
  * Dismissing criticism
  * Marketing speak
  * Asking for upvotes
  * Being evasive
  * Ignoring technical questions
