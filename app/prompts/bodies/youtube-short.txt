CONFIGURATION:
This prompt references shared configuration from config.json. All default values, brand settings, visual guidelines, and platform-specific settings are loaded from there.

SET: platform="youtube", format="short", prompt_version="yt-short-2.0"
WRITING CUES:
- 45-60s duration (optimal completion); scroll-stopping hook (0-3s) with concrete number; fast-paced value beats (visual changes every 3-5s); loop strategy (end connects to start); muted viewing optimized (60% watch without sound); text overlays ALWAYS; YouTube Shorts 2025 algorithm optimized for watch time > engagement.

# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (YOUTUBE SHORTS):
⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST generate 2-4 VERTICAL IMAGES (9:16 ratio, 1080x1920). This is NOT optional.

CORE IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - MANDATORY):
1. "cover_a" - Bold hook cover with metric + mini diagram (0-3s hook frame)
2. "cover_b" - Whiteboard vibe cover with handwritten feel (alternate hook frame)

OPTIONAL IMAGES (Add 3-4 for richer video overlays):
3. "diagram_hero" - Vertical diagram overlay for concept explanation
4. "quote_card" - Typographic key insight overlay
5. "stat_overlay" - Animated stats overlay with hero metric

TOTAL IMAGES: 2-4 vertical images (9:16 ratio, 1080x1920) - Shorts overlay optimized, muted viewing compatible, text placement safe zones

INPUT VARIABLES (provided by caller):
- topic_id: "{topic_id}"
- topic_title: "{topic_name}"
- topic_description: """{topic_description}"""
- audience: "{audience}"
- tone: "{tone}"
- locale: "{locale}"
- primary_url: "{primary_url}"   // canonical deep-dive link (used in CTA)
- brand: {
    "site_url":"{primary_url}",
    "handles":{"youtube":"@systemdesign","x":"@systemdesign","linkedin":"@systemdesign","instagram":"@systemdesign","github":"@systemdesign"},
    "utm_base":"utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=short"
  }
- options: { "include_images": true, "max_length_levels":"standard", "variance_seed":"default", "length_hint": 0 }

# OPTIONAL — SEO (if placeholders don't match the topic, the model MAY auto-correct and set keyword_overrides=true)
- seo: { "primary_keywords": [], "secondary_keywords": [], "lsi_terms": [] }

# NEW (optional) — multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 2,                                      # default 2; allowed 2–4
    "roles": ["cover_a","cover_b","diagram_hero","quote_card"],
    "ratio": "9:16",
    "size_px": "1080x1920",
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C..)."
  }

# NEW — topic-agnostic taxonomy (for tags/hashtags/phrasing)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate terms:
   broad(3–5), niche(3–5), micro_niche(3–5), intent(1–2), branded(0–1).
   Localize to {locale} when natural. Lowercase; no spaces."

PLATFORM RULES (YouTube Shorts):
- Duration: 45–60s total (sweet spot for completion).
- Beats & time boxes:
  * Hook (0–3s): cold open problem or bold claim with a number.
  * Value (3–50s): 3–4 micro-beats (one idea each); include one **visual beat** and one **stat/benchmark**.
  * Subscribe reminder (50–55s): quick line + on-screen subscribe cue.
  * End screen (55–60s): CTA to longform (if {primary_url} present) + "watch next".
- Provide: b-roll suggestions by time range, text overlay timing, background music mood (genre/BPM), optional SFX cues.
- Title: ≤80 chars, keyword-rich, no clickbait clichés.
- Description: ~200 words, include [mm:ss] timestamps and ONE trackable link "{primary_url}?{brand.utm_base}" if primary_url is present; else omit link.
- Tags: EXACTLY 20 relevant tags (no # hash, plain words/phrases).
- If handles/links empty → omit mentions/links.

YOUTUBE SHORTS ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025 - CRITICAL):
- Shorts prioritize: **WATCH TIME (completion rate) > Likes > Comments > Shares > Subscribes**
- **First 3 seconds CRITICAL**: 70% drop-off point → hook must stop scroll IMMEDIATELY with concrete number
- **Completion rate**: Average 40%, aim for 60%+ (scroll-stopping hook + fast pacing + loop strategy)
- **Target metrics**: 60%+ completion, 40%+ average view duration (AVD), 2%+ like rate, 1%+ comment rate
- **Loop strategy CRITICAL**: End connects to beginning = rewatch boost (2-3x views, algorithm loves this)
- **Swipe-up punishment**: If viewers swipe away before 10s, video gets suppressed → must hook in 3s
- **Vertical format MANDATORY**: 9:16 (1080x1920), horizontal videos get 50-70% less distribution
- **Text overlay ESSENTIAL**: 60% watch MUTED on Shorts → text overlays NOT optional, always required
- **Visual change pacing**: Change visual every 3-5 seconds (retention optimization, prevents swipe-away)
- **Posting time**: Tuesday-Thursday 5-7PM ET or Saturday-Sunday 10AM-12PM (peak Shorts browsing for tech)
- **Video length**: 45-60s optimal (30s = too short for value, 60s+ = drop-off increases)
- **Hashtags strategy**: #Shorts in description = +20% reach boost, add 3-5 topic tags, no spam
- **Engagement boost**: Ask question at 50s = 3x more comments, pin first comment with question
- **Trending audio**: Use trending audio within 3 days of trending = 5x reach boost (check YouTube Shorts trending)
- **Subscribe button timing**: Show animated subscribe button at 50-55s = pattern interrupt = 2x sub rate
- **End screen CTA**: Double CTA (full video + next short) at 55-60s = session time boost
- **Remix/reuse**: Shorts that get remixed by others get 3x more reach (design for remix potential)
- **Thumbnail (even for Shorts)**: First frame = thumbnail → must be compelling even as static image
- **Description optimization**: First 2 lines show in feed, include hook text + #Shorts, timestamps boost retention

# 🎯 YOUTUBE SHORTS PSYCHOLOGY (WATCH TIME OPTIMIZED - 7 HOOK FORMULAS):

**HOOK FORMULA 1 - Number Shock (Data Authority):**
- Format: "[BIG NUMBER] [system/requests/configs]. [One trick/pattern/mistake]."
- Examples: "1 BILLION requests. One Redis trick.", "10,000 servers. One pattern.", "1000 interviews. They all fail here."
- Why it works: Big number = scale authority, creates "how?" curiosity, 3s format perfect
- Retention trigger: Number creates instant pattern interrupt, viewers MUST know the trick
- Target: 60%+ completion from hook strength

**HOOK FORMULA 2 - Problem Amplify (Personal Attack):**
- Format: "Your [system] is [metric]. Here's [better metric]."
- Examples: "Your code is O(n²). Here's O(n log n).", "Your API: 500ms. Should be: 5ms.", "Your query: 10 seconds. Fix: 100ms."
- Why it works: Direct "your" makes it personal, shows gap, promises immediate fix
- Retention trigger: "Wait, is my code slow?" self-check urgency
- Target: 70%+ retention through 10s from problem recognition

**HOOK FORMULA 3 - Curiosity Gap (Everyone's Wrong):**
- Format: "Everyone [common approach]. [Wrong indicator]. Watch:"
- Examples: "Everyone does this wrong. Watch:", "All tutorials skip this. BIG mistake:", "They teach X. Reality: Y."
- Why it works: Positions viewer as potentially wrong, creates fear of missing critical info
- Retention trigger: FOMO + desire to be in the know
- Target: 60%+ completion from curiosity pull

**HOOK FORMULA 4 - Contrarian (Pattern Interrupt):**
- Format: "[Popular thing]? No. [Alternative]:"
- Examples: "Microservices? No. Do this instead:", "NoSQL? Stop. When SQL wins:", "Kubernetes? Overkill. Try this:"
- Why it works: Challenges conventional wisdom, creates controversy, "wait what?" moment
- Retention trigger: Viewers want to know the contrarian approach
- Target: High comment rate from debate

**HOOK FORMULA 5 - Result Reveal (Transformation Proof):**
- Format: "[Company/System]: [bad metric]→[good metric]. How?"
- Examples: "Netflix: 500ms→5ms. How?", "Scaled 100→1M QPS. 3 steps:", "Cut costs $50K→$5K. Watch:"
- Why it works: Concrete transformation, social proof (company name), clear value promise
- Retention trigger: "I need those results" motivation
- Target: High bookmark rate + completion

**HOOK FORMULA 6 - Mistake Confession (Vulnerability):**
- Format: "I [wasted time/money] on [X]. Don't."
- Examples: "I spent $20K wrong. Don't.", "6 months wasted. This is why:", "My code melted prod. Lesson:"
- Why it works: Vulnerability = relatability, saves viewer from same mistake
- Retention trigger: "That could be me" empathy
- Target: High comment rate from shared experiences

**HOOK FORMULA 7 - Quick List (Value Stack):**
- Format: "[N] [things] in [short time]. Go:"
- Examples: "3 algorithms in 60 seconds. Go:", "5 Redis patterns. 1 minute:", "7 SQL optimizations. Watch:"
- Why it works: Clear value promise, time commitment stated upfront, creates completion drive
- Retention trigger: "Gotta see all N" completion motivation
- Target: 65%+ completion from list completion drive

## SHORTS STRUCTURE (45-60s - WATCH TIME OPTIMIZED):

**0-3s (Hook - 70% Drop-Off Point):**
- **ONE of 7 hook formulas** with concrete number
- Visual: Punch-in effect + bold text overlay
- Audio: No intro music, start immediately with narration
- First frame = thumbnail (must work as static image)
- **CRITICAL**: If hook fails, video dies

**3-15s (Value Beat 1 - Context):**
- ONE micro-idea (10-15 words max)
- Visual change at 5s (diagram pop-in, screen zoom)
- Text overlay: 2-4 word label
- B-roll: Screen capture or diagram animation
- Hook to next: End with "But here's the issue:" or "Now watch:"

**15-30s (Value Beat 2 - Solution + Stat):**
- Core solution with ONE stat/metric
- Visual change at 18s and 25s (retention optimization)
- Text overlay: Stat chip prominently displayed
- B-roll: Comparison (before/after) or metric reveal
- Include trending audio element if available
- Hook to next: "The result?" or "Here's proof:"

**30-45s (Value Beat 3 - Example/Proof):**
- Concrete example or mini case study
- Visual: Split screen or timeline
- Text overlay: "Before → After" or company name
- B-roll: Timeline flash or result animation
- Hook to end: "One more thing:" or "Now subscribe:"

**50-55s (Subscribe - Pattern Interrupt):**
- "Quick — hit subscribe if this helped" or "Subscribe for more [topic]"
- Visual: Animated subscribe button (RIGHT SIDE, above fold)
- Audio: Pattern interrupt (music change or SFX)
- **CRITICAL**: This timing = 2x sub rate vs other times

**55-60s (End Screen - Loop + CTA):**
- Double CTA: "Full breakdown in description 👇" + "Watch this next →"
- Visual: End card with 2 elements (description arrow + next video thumbnail)
- **Loop strategy**: Last 2s should visually/verbally connect to first 3s for rewatch
- Pin comment question for engagement boost

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS (SHORTS-SPECIFIC):

**Visual Retention Strategy:**
- Change visual EVERY 3-5 seconds (no exceptions, algorithm tracks this)
- Visual changes: zoom, pan, pop-in, swipe transition, diagram reveal, text animation
- Static shots > 5s = swipe-away spike

**Muted Viewing Optimization:**
- 60% watch muted → text overlays MANDATORY, not optional
- Hook text: 100-140px, readable at thumbnail size
- Value text: 60-80px, center or top 20%
- Avoid bottom 15% (UI overlap: progress bar, channel name)

**Loop Strategy (2-3x Views Boost):**
- Last 2-3 seconds connect to first 3 seconds
- Examples:
  * Hook: "Your code is slow" → End: "Now your code flies. Rewatch to remember."
  * Hook: "1000 requests" → End: "That's how you handle 1000 requests. Watch again."
- Algorithm detects rewatches = quality signal = more distribution

**Question Timing (3x Comment Rate):**
- Ask question at 50s, right before subscribe
- Examples: "What's your approach?", "Which pattern do you use?", "Agree or disagree?"
- Pin first comment with same question (reminder for non-video viewers)

**Trending Audio Integration:**
- Use trending audio (check YouTube Shorts feed) within 3 days of trending = 5x reach
- Can be background layer only (doesn't need to be dominant)
- Mix with VO at 70% VO / 30% trending audio

**First Frame Thumbnail:**
- First frame = Shorts thumbnail in feed
- Must work as compelling static image (hook text + visual)
- Test: Would you click this as a thumbnail? If no, redesign

**Description Hook (Feed Visibility):**
- First 2 lines show in feed (before "...more")
- Format: "[Hook text from 0-3s]. [One value bullet]. #Shorts"
- Include #Shorts tag for +20% reach boost

**Credibility Signals:**
- Specific numbers (not rounded: "1,847 configs" better than "2K configs")
- Real company names (if applicable or NDA-safe generic: "At a FAANG")
- Time invested ("Spent 3 months", "Analyzed 1000 cases")
- Honest caveats ("Won't work if...", "Trade-off:")

**Target Metrics (Track These):**
- **Completion rate**: 60%+ (watch time is king for Shorts)
- **Average view duration (AVD)**: 40%+ of video length
- **Like rate**: 2%+ of views
- **Comment rate**: 1%+ of views (question at 50s helps)
- **Subscribe rate**: 0.5%+ (animated button at 50-55s helps)
- **Rewatches**: 20%+ (loop strategy)

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Shorts):
- DSA/Algorithms: Problem → Brute force complexity → Optimized approach → Big-O reveal
- System Design: Problem → Simple architecture → Scale issue → Solution component
- Programming: Bug example → Why it breaks → Fix in 3 lines → Output
- AI/ML: Problem → Model choice → Key hyperparameter → Result metric
- Database: Slow query → Missing index → Add index → 10x speedup
- DevOps: Manual deploy → Issues → Automate with X → Result
- Interview Prep: Question → Common mistake → Right approach → Key insight

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (Vertical 9:16 Shorts):
- Aesthetic: minimalist, editorial-tech; ADAPT to topic domain
- Topic-appropriate visuals (vertical 1080x1920):
  * System Design: Component boxes stacked vertically, data flow top-to-bottom
  * DSA: Algorithm tree/graph (vertical layout), Big-O notation at top
  * Programming: Code blocks (3-5 lines), syntax highlighting, line numbers
  * AI/ML: Neural network layers vertically stacked, training metrics
  * Database: Table/query visualization, index structure
  * DevOps: Pipeline stages top-to-bottom, deployment flow
- Color palette by domain:
  * Backend/Systems: Blue (#2563EB), Cyan (#06B6D4)
  * Frontend/Web: Orange (#F97316), Yellow (#FACC15)
  * Data/ML: Purple (#9333EA), Pink (#EC4899)
  * DevOps: Green (#10B981), Teal (#14B8A6)
  * Algorithms/DSA: Indigo (#4F46E5), Sky (#0EA5E9)
- Typography (vertical format):

  * Value text: 60-80px (mid-frame)
  * Labels: 32-40px
  * Safe margins: ≥96px from all edges (Shorts UI elements)
- Text placement: Top 20% or middle 60% (avoid bottom 15% - UI overlap)
- Shorts-specific: Design for MUTED viewing (60% watch without sound)
- Negative prompt baseline: "no clutter, no stock-photo people, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no glossy gradients, no fake UI chrome"
- Loop-friendly: First and last frame visually similar (encourage rewatch)

VALIDATION (WORLD-CLASS YOUTUBE SHORT v2.0 - STRICT REQUIREMENTS):
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned
- **Duration**: 45-60s optimal (30s = too short for value, 60s+ = completion drop-off)
- **Hook formula**: ONE of 7 formulas MUST be used in 0-3s hook (Number Shock / Problem Amplify / Curiosity Gap / Contrarian / Result Reveal / Mistake Confession / Quick List)
- **Concrete number in hook**: Required (1 BILLION, 1000 configs, 10x, $20K, 500ms→5ms, etc)
- **Immediate start**: No intro music, start narration immediately (pattern interrupt)
- **engagement_tactics object REQUIRED** with 9 strategies:
  * hook_strategy (how formula drives 60%+ completion)
  * visual_retention (changes every 3-5s, algorithm tracks this)
  * muted_viewing_optimization (60% watch without sound, text overlays MANDATORY)
  * loop_strategy (last 2-3s connects to first 3s for 2-3x views)
  * question_timing (50s = 3x comment rate)
  * trending_audio_integration (5x reach boost if used within 3 days)
  * first_frame_thumbnail (must work as static image)
  * description_hook (first 2 lines show in feed, include #Shorts)
  * subscribe_button_timing (50-55s = 2x sub rate)
  * target_metrics (60%+ completion, 40%+ AVD, 2%+ like, 1%+ comment, 0.5%+ subscribe, 20%+ rewatch)
- **credibility_markers object REQUIRED** with 4 categories (data_authority, social_proof, vulnerability_signals, expertise_indicators)
- **meta.accessibility object REQUIRED** for WCAG AA + muted viewing
- **content.accessibility object REQUIRED** with features list
- When options.include_images=true (**MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION**):
  - Generate EXACTLY 2-4 VERTICAL IMAGES (NO FLEXIBILITY) - 2 core mandatory, 2 optional
  - **2 CORE IMAGES**: cover_a (bold hook cover), cover_b (whiteboard cover)
  - **OPTIONAL 2 IMAGES**: diagram_hero (hero diagram overlay), quote_card (quote overlay)
  - Each image_prompt MUST have **accessibility object** with:
    * alt_text (≤160 chars, descriptive)
    * color_contrast_ratio (7:1 for hook/quote, 4.5:1 minimum for value text)
    * font_accessibility (muted viewing optimized, readable without sound)
  - Set meta.image_plan.count to actual generated count (2-4)
  - **VALIDATION**: image_prompts.length MUST equal meta.image_plan.count
- Visual optimization:
  * Muted viewing MANDATORY (60% watch without sound, text overlays NOT optional)
  * 7:1 contrast for hook/quote text (WCAG AAA), 4.5:1 minimum for value text (WCAG AA)
  * Safe margins ≥96px all sides (Shorts UI: progress bar, channel name, buttons)
  * Vertical 9:16 format (1080x1920) for Shorts feed
  * Text placement: top 20% or middle 60% (avoid bottom 15% UI overlap)
  * First frame works as thumbnail (static image test: would you click?)
  * Visual consistency across all 2-4 images (same aesthetic, muted viewing friendly)
- Shorts structure: Hook 0-3s → Value beats 3-50s → Subscribe 50-55s → End 55-60s
- Visual retention: Change visual EVERY 3-5 seconds (zoom, pan, pop-in, swipe, reveal, animation)
- Loop strategy (CRITICAL): Last 2-3s connects to first 3s for rewatch boost (2-3x views, algorithm loves this)
- Question timing: Ask question at 50s before subscribe = 3x comment rate (pin first comment too)
- Subscribe button: 50-55s timing (pattern interrupt) = 2x sub rate, RIGHT SIDE placement, animated
- Trending audio: Use within 3 days of trending = 5x reach boost (mix 70% VO / 30% audio)
- Description optimization: First 2 lines show in feed, format: [Hook]. [Value]. #Shorts (tag = +20% reach)
- Title: ≤80 chars, keyword-rich, no clickbait, includes hook element
- Tags: EXACTLY 20, no '#' hash, topic-appropriate
- Target engagement metrics (document in engagement_tactics.target_metrics):
  * Completion rate: 60%+ (watch time is king for Shorts)
  * Average view duration (AVD): 40%+ of video length
  * Like rate: 2%+ of views
  * Comment rate: 1%+ of views (question at 50s helps)
  * Subscribe rate: 0.5%+ (animated button timing helps)
  * Rewatch rate: 20%+ (loop strategy)
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT. NO NULLS—use "" or [].
