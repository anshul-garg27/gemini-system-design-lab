# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (X/TWITTER THREAD):
⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST generate 2-4 WIDE IMAGES (16:9 ratio, 1600x900). This is NOT optional.

CORE IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - MANDATORY):
1. "hero_a" - Insight card with metric + mini diagram (attach to tweet 3)
2. "diagram_b" - Flow diagram with annotations (attach to tweet 4)

OPTIONAL IMAGES (Add 3-4 for richer threads):
3. "stat_card" - Metrics panel with hero number (tweet 5-6)
4. "quote_card" - Typographic key insight (tweet 6-7)

TOTAL IMAGES: 2-4 wide images (16:9 ratio, 1600x900) - X feed optimized, dark mode compatible

INPUT VARIABLES (provided by caller):
- topic_id: "{topic_id}"
- topic_title: "{topic_name}"
- topic_description: """{topic_description}"""
- audience: "{audience}"
- tone: "{tone}"
- locale: "{locale}"
- primary_url: "{primary_url}"   // canonical link for deep-dive
- brand: {
    "site_url":"{primary_url}",
    "handles":{"x":"@systemdesign","linkedin":"@systemdesign","instagram":"@systemdesign","youtube":"@systemdesign","github":"@systemdesign"},
    "utm_base":"utm_source=x&utm_medium=thread"
  }
- options: { "include_images": true, "max_length_levels":"standard", "variance_seed":"default", "length_hint": 0 }

# OPTIONAL — SEO (if placeholders don't match the topic, the model MAY auto-correct and set keyword_overrides=true)
- seo: {
    "primary_keywords": ["system design", "architecture", "scalability"],
    "secondary_keywords": ["distributed systems", "microservices", "performance"],
    "lsi_terms": ["load balancing", "database sharding", "caching"]
  }

# NEW (optional) — multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 2,                         # default 2; allowed 2–4
    "roles": ["hero_a","diagram_b","stat_card","quote_card"],
    "ratio": "16:9",
    "size_px": "1600x900",
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C..)."
  }

# NEW — topic-agnostic taxonomy (for hashtags & phrasing)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate tags:
   broad(3–5), niche(3–5), micro_niche(3–5), intent(1–2), branded(0–1).
   Localize to {locale} when natural. Lowercase; no spaces."

PLATFORM RULES (X Thread):
- 5–9 tweets total. Each tweet ≤280 characters **including** mentions/hashtags.
- Tweet 1 = **hook with a number promise** (e.g., time, %, count).
- Middle tweets: exactly one idea per tweet. Include at least one **statistic** and one **mini-example**.
- Include a **diagram/number link** mid-thread:
  - if {primary_url} present → include one trackable link: "{primary_url}?{brand.utm_base}" in Tweet 3 or 4.
  - else omit any external link.
- Last tweet = short **summary + CTA** (follow, bookmark, discuss).
- Hashtags: **max 2 per tweet**; provide a global shortlist too.
- Mentions: propose 2–5 relevant handles overall; use at most 1 handle per tweet.
- Alt text for images is required.

X/TWITTER ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025 - CRITICAL):
- X prioritizes: **ENGAGEMENT > Impressions** (replies > quote tweets > retweets > likes)
- **Thread performance CRITICAL**: First tweet gets 80% of impressions, rest get 20-40% → hook must be perfect
- **Hook tweet (Tweet 1) DECISIVE**: Must stop scroll in 1-2 seconds, concrete number required
- **Thread completion rate**: Average 40%, aim for 60%+ (7-9 tweets optimal - value without fatigue)
- **Target metrics**: 2%+ engagement rate, 60%+ thread completion, 50+ replies (enterprise tech threads)
- **Reply amplification**: Threads with 50+ replies get 10x more reach, controversial/discussion-worthy = 5x boost
- **Quote tweets > Retweets**: Quote tweets show in more feeds + your followers' feeds = 3x distribution
- **Posting time (B2B tech)**: Tuesday-Thursday 9-11AM or 1-3PM ET (peak engagement), avoid weekends
- **Blue check boost**: Verified accounts get 2x reach + prioritized in replies, but organic still works
- **Thread length optimization**: 7-9 tweets sweet spot (5 tweets = too short for value, 10+ = drop-off)
- **Image engagement**: Tweets with images get 2x engagement, attach in tweets 3-4 (mid-thread visual break)
- **Hashtags strategy**: 1-2 max per thread (more = spam signal), use in tweets 1 & 7 only
- **Link suppression CRITICAL**: External links reduce reach by 50-70% → ONLY put link in LAST tweet or first reply
- **Numbered format**: Use "1/7" format in tweet 1 → signals value + sets completion expectation
- **First hour critical**: 20-30 engagements in first hour = viral trajectory activated, reply to all comments immediately
- **Thread momentum**: Each tweet should hook to next ("Here's why:" → deliver in next tweet)
- **Dark mode optimization**: 60% of X users use dark mode → images must work in dark theme

# 🎯 X THREAD PSYCHOLOGY (ENGAGEMENT-OPTIMIZED - 7 HOOK FORMULAS):

**HOOK FORMULA 1 - Number + Time (Data Authority):**
- Format: "I [analyzed/studied/built] [N] [things] over [timeframe]. [X%] [shocking finding]. Thread 🧵"
- Examples: "I analyzed 1000 Redis configs over 3 months. 87% make this mistake.", "Reviewed 500 system design interviews. 73% fail on this question.", "Built 50 APIs. Here's the pattern that scales."
- Why it works: Numbers = credibility, time = sacrifice, finding = value promise
- Engagement trigger: Curiosity about mistake/finding, "Am I doing this?" self-check
- Target: 60%+ thread completion from hook strength

**HOOK FORMULA 2 - Shocking Stat (Problem Amplification):**
- Format: "Your [system] is [N]x [worse metric] than it should be. Here's why:"
- Examples: "Your database is 10x slower than it should be. Here's why:", "Your API wastes 80% of resources. 7 fixes:", "Your algorithm is O(n²). Should be O(n log n). Thread:"
- Why it works: Personal problem + specific number + promise of solution
- Engagement trigger: "Wait, that's me!" recognition, urgency to fix
- Target: 2%+ engagement rate from problem resonance

**HOOK FORMULA 3 - Curiosity Gap (Contrarian Edge):**
- Format: "Everyone uses [common approach]. I use [better approach]. Thread 🧵"
- Examples: "Everyone uses O(n²). I use O(n log n). Thread.", "Most use REST. We use GraphQL. 5x faster.", "They scale vertically. We scale horizontally. Here's why:"
- Why it works: Positions you as insider, creates "what's the secret?" gap
- Engagement trigger: FOMO (fear of missing optimization), desire to be insider
- Target: 50+ replies from people sharing their approach

**HOOK FORMULA 4 - Contrarian Take (Polarizing Boost):**
- Format: "[Popular thing] is overrated. Here's what works better:"
- Examples: "Microservices are overrated. Here's what works better:", "NoSQL isn't always the answer. When SQL wins:", "Kubernetes is overkill for most teams. Simpler approach:"
- Why it works: Mild controversy = people want to agree/disagree = replies
- Engagement trigger: Debate invitation (supporters + challengers both reply)
- Target: 5x reach amplification from controversial topic

**HOOK FORMULA 5 - Result Reveal (Proof-First):**
- Format: "We went from [bad metric] to [good metric] in [timeframe]. [N] steps:"
- Examples: "Went from 500ms to 5ms latency in 2 weeks. 7 steps:", "Scaled from 100 to 1M QPS. Here's how:", "Cut AWS bill from $50K to $5K. 5 changes:"
- Why it works: Concrete proof + specific numbers + actionable promise
- Engagement trigger: "I need those results" motivation
- Target: 60%+ completion rate, high bookmarks

**HOOK FORMULA 6 - Mistake Confession (Vulnerability):**
- Format: "I spent [time/money] doing [X] wrong. Here's what I learned:"
- Examples: "Spent $20K on wrong architecture. Here's what I'd do now:", "6 months optimizing the wrong thing. The real bottleneck:", "Thought O(n) was fine. Production melted. Lesson:"
- Why it works: Vulnerability = relatability, saves others from same mistake
- Engagement trigger: "Happened to me too" replies, sharing their mistakes
- Target: High reply rate from empathy

**HOOK FORMULA 7 - List Promise (Value Stack):**
- Format: "[N] [techniques/lessons/tricks] for [outcome]. Thread 🧵"
- Examples: "7 database patterns that scale to 1M QPS. Thread:", "5 algorithms every engineer should know:", "9 architecture mistakes I see repeatedly:"
- Why it works: Clear value proposition, numbered format sets completion expectation
- Engagement trigger: "Gotta read all N" completion drive, bookmark for later
- Target: High bookmark rate, thread completion

## THREAD STRUCTURE (7-9 TWEETS - OPTIMIZED FLOW):

**Tweet 1 (Hook - 80% of Impressions):**
- **ONE of 7 hook formulas** with concrete number
- Include "Thread 🧵" or "1/7" to signal value
- NO links (link suppression), NO excessive hashtags (max 1)
- Length: 220-260 chars (leaves room for engagement replies)

**Tweets 2-3 (Context Setup):**
- Tweet 2: Problem/context (one idea, 15-20 words)
- Tweet 3: Why it matters (stat or cost, attach IMAGE 1 here)
- Each ends with hook to next tweet ("Here's why:" "The solution:")
- NO links in these tweets (algorithm suppression)

**Tweets 4-6 (Value Delivery):**
- Tweet 4: Core solution (attach IMAGE 2 here, diagram/flow)
- Tweet 5: How it works (concrete example or code snippet)
- Tweet 6: Trade-offs/caveats (builds credibility, shows expertise)
- ONE idea per tweet, numbered format ("4/ Solution:", "5/ How:")

**Tweet 7 (Proof/Credibility):**
- Real company example ("Netflix does this for...")
- Personal experience with numbers ("We tried X, it failed. Then Y = 10x improvement.")
- Or case study ("Airbnb scaled from 100 to 1M requests using...")

**Tweet 8-9 (CTA + Link - LAST TWEETS ONLY):**
- Tweet 8: Summary + layered CTA
  * "Found this useful? → Follow @handle for more [topic]"
  * "Bookmark 🔖 this thread to reference later"
  * "What's your experience? Reply below 👇" (reply bait)
- Tweet 9 (or first reply): Link placement
  * "Full deep-dive + code examples: [link]" ← PUT LINK HERE to avoid suppression
  * Or: "Want more? [link]" in first reply (bypasses algorithm suppression)

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS (X-SPECIFIC):

**Thread Momentum (Hook to Next):**
- Every tweet 1-6 ends with transition that hooks to next
- Examples: "Here's why:", "The solution:", "But there's a catch:", "Here's how:", "The result:"
- Creates "must keep reading" pull, drives 60%+ completion

**Reply Bait Strategies:**
- **Question in last tweet**: "What's your approach?" (invites sharing)
- **Controversial statement**: "Microservices are overrated" (invites debate)
- **Ask for experiences**: "Anyone else dealt with this?" (empathy replies)
- **Binary choice**: "REST or GraphQL? Reply below" (easy engagement)
- **Tag pattern**: "Tag someone who needs this" (organic reach expansion)

**First Hour Strategy (20-30 Engagements Goal):**
- Reply to ALL comments immediately (within 5 minutes)
- Ask follow-up questions in your replies
- Quote tweet interesting replies (rewards engagement)
- Pin thread to profile for more visibility
- Share in first reply with additional context

**Link Strategy (Avoid Suppression):**
- **CRITICAL**: External links reduce reach by 50-70%
- **ONLY put link in**: Last tweet (tweet 7-9) OR first reply (best option)
- **Never** put links in tweets 1-6 (kills thread momentum + algorithm suppression)
- Format: "Full guide: [link]" in last tweet or "🔗 Deep-dive: [link]" in first reply

**Visual Break Strategy:**
- Attach IMAGE 1 to tweet 3 (provides visual break, 2x engagement)
- Attach IMAGE 2 to tweet 4 (diagram/flow reinforces concept)
- Images must work in dark mode (60% of users)
- 16:9 format optimized for X feed (504x283px preview)

**Credibility Signals:**
- Specific numbers (not rounded: "$4,873/mo" better than "$5K/mo")
- Real company names ("At Stripe" if true, "At a Series B fintech" if NDA)
- Time invested ("Spent 3 months", "Analyzed 1000 configs")
- Honest caveats ("This won't work if...", "Trade-off: slower writes")
- Personal failures ("We tried X first, it failed. Then Y...")

**Target Metrics (Track These):**
- **Engagement rate**: 2%+ (enterprise tech threads)
- **Thread completion**: 60%+ (tweet 7 views / tweet 1 views)
- **Replies**: 50+ (unlocks 10x reach amplification)
- **Quote tweets**: 10+ (3x distribution boost vs retweets)
- **First hour engagements**: 20-30 (activates viral trajectory)
- **Bookmarks**: High (saves = quality signal to algorithm)

VALIDATION (WORLD-CLASS X/TWITTER THREAD v2.0 - STRICT REQUIREMENTS):
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned
- **Thread length**: 7-9 tweets optimal (5 = too short, 10+ = completion drop-off)
- **Hook formula**: ONE of 7 formulas MUST be used in tweet 1 (Number+Time / Shocking Stat / Curiosity Gap / Contrarian / Result Reveal / Mistake / List)
- **Concrete number in hook**: Required (87%, 1000 configs, 10x, $20K, 5ms, etc)
- **Thread signal**: Include "Thread 🧵" or "1/7" format in tweet 1
- **engagement_tactics object REQUIRED** with 6 strategies:
  * hook_strategy (how formula drives engagement)
  * thread_momentum (how each tweet hooks to next for 60%+ completion)
  * reply_bait (strategies in last tweet for 50+ replies)
  * link_suppression_strategy (CRITICAL - links reduce reach 50-70%, ONLY in last tweet/reply)
  * visual_break_timing (images tweets 3-4 for 2x engagement)
  * first_hour_plan (20-30 engagements activates viral trajectory)
  * target_metrics (2%+ engagement, 60%+ completion, 50+ replies, 10+ quote tweets, 20-30 first hour)
- **credibility_markers object REQUIRED** with 4 categories (data_authority, social_proof, vulnerability_signals, expertise_indicators)
- **meta.accessibility object REQUIRED** for WCAG AA + dark mode
- **content.accessibility object REQUIRED** with features list
- When options.include_images=true (**MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION**):
  - Generate EXACTLY 2-4 WIDE IMAGES (NO FLEXIBILITY) - 2 core mandatory, 2 optional
  - **2 CORE IMAGES**: hero_a (insight card - attach tweet 3), diagram_b (flow diagram - attach tweet 4)
  - **OPTIONAL 2 IMAGES**: stat_card (metrics - tweet 5-6), quote_card (key insight - tweet 6-7)
  - Each image_prompt MUST have **accessibility object** with:
    * alt_text (≤160 chars, descriptive)
    * color_contrast_ratio (7:1 for headlines, 4.5:1 minimum for body)
    * font_accessibility (X feed preview legible, dark mode compatible)
  - Set meta.image_plan.count to actual generated count (2-4)
  - **VALIDATION**: image_prompts.length MUST equal meta.image_plan.count
- Visual optimization:
  * Dark mode compatible (60% of X users use dark mode)
  * 7:1 contrast for headlines (WCAG AAA), 4.5:1 minimum for body (WCAG AA)
  * Safe margins ≥48px all sides
  * Wide 16:9 format (1600x900) for X feed preview (504x283px)
  * Visual consistency across all 2-4 images (same professional aesthetic)
- Thread structure: Each tweet ≤280 chars, one idea per tweet
- Thread momentum: Tweets 1-6 end with hooks to next ("Here's why:" "The solution:" "But there's a catch:")
- Link strategy (CRITICAL FOR ALGORITHM):
  * External links reduce reach by 50-70%
  * ONLY put link in last tweet (8-9) OR first reply (best option)
  * NEVER put links in tweets 1-6 (kills thread momentum + algorithm suppression)
- Hashtags: 1-2 MAX per thread (more = spam signal to algorithm), use in tweets 1 & 8 only
- Target engagement metrics (document in engagement_tactics.target_metrics):
  * Engagement rate: 2%+ of impressions (enterprise tech threads)
  * Thread completion: 60%+ (tweet 7 views / tweet 1 views)
  * Replies: 50+ (unlocks 10x reach amplification)
  * Quote tweets: 10+ (3x distribution boost vs retweets)
  * First hour engagements: 20-30 (activates viral trajectory)
  * Bookmarks: High (quality signal to algorithm)
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT. NO NULLS—use "" or [].
