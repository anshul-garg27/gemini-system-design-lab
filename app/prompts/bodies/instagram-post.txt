SET: platform="instagram", format="post", prompt_version="ig-post-2.0"
WRITING CUES:
- Visual-first storytelling; scroll-stopping design; micro-blog caption (150‚Äì200 words); topic-adaptive; Instagram 2025 algorithm optimized; saves-worthy content; engagement-driven.

# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (WORLD-CLASS STANDARD):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST generate ALL 3 CORE IMAGES + 1-2 optional based on topic. This is NOT optional.

CORE 3 IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. "main_visual" - Primary post visual (scroll-stopping design)
2. "main_visual_alt" - Alternative design for A/B testing
3. "shareable_card" - Stats/quote card optimized for saves & shares

OPTIONAL IMAGES (Add 1-2 based on topic complexity):
4. "diagram_card" - For complex concepts (System Design, DSA, DevOps)
5. "code_snippet" - For programming/algorithm topics
6. "before_after" - For optimization/transformation stories

TOTAL IMAGES: 3 core + 1-2 optional = 4-5 images (ALWAYS)

INPUT VARIABLES (provided by caller):
- topic_id: "{topic_id}"
- topic_title: "{topic_name}"
- topic_description: """{topic_description}"""
- audience: "{audience}"
- tone: "{tone}"
- locale: "{locale}"
- primary_url: "{primary_url}"
- brand: { "site_url":"{primary_url}",
           "handles":{"instagram":"@systemdesign","x":"@systemdesign","linkedin":"@systemdesign","youtube":"@systemdesign","github":"@systemdesign"},
           "utm_base":"utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=post" }
- seo:
  { "primary_keywords": ["system design", "architecture", "scalability"],
    "secondary_keywords": ["distributed systems", "microservices", "performance"],
    "lsi_terms": ["load balancing", "database sharding", "caching"] }
- options:
  { "include_images": true,
    "max_length_levels":"standard",
    "variance_seed":"default",
    "length_hint": 180 }

# NEW (optional) ‚Äî multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 2,                                      # default 2; allowed 2‚Äì4
    "roles": ["visual_diagram","visual_typography","stat_card","pattern_bg"],
    "ratio": "4:5",
    "size_px": "1080x1350",
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C..)."
  }

IMAGE SPECS (ALL images):
- Ratio: "4:5" (1080x1350) - Instagram feed format (performs 20% better than square)
- Safe margins: ‚â•64px from all edges (Instagram safe area)
- Thumbnail readable: Must be legible at 293x366px (feed thumbnail size)
- Color contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio (7:1 for headlines/CTAs)
- Format: PNG, RGB, 72 DPI, <500KB for fast loading
- Mobile-first: 80% of viewers on mobile - design for small screens
- Screenshot-friendly: Users screenshot and share - make it shareable quality

VALIDATION:
- image_prompts array length MUST be ‚â•4 (3 core + 1-2 optional)
- Each prompt MUST include: role, title, prompt, negative_prompt, style_notes, ratio, size_px, alt_text, accessibility object
- Set meta.image_plan.count to actual total generated (4-5)
- Set meta.image_plan.mandatory_roles with all 3 core roles
- Set meta.image_plan.optional_roles with chosen optional images

# NEW (generic topic taxonomy; if your provided SEO lists are placeholders, you MAY auto-correct them)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate tags when necessary:
   broad(5‚Äì7), niche(8‚Äì10), micro_niche(6‚Äì10), intent(3‚Äì5), branded(0‚Äì2).
   Use locale when natural. Lowercase; no spaces (camelCase/underscores ok)."
AUTO-CORRECTION RULE (safe):
- If provided SEO keywords obviously do not match {topic_title}/{topic_description}, infer replacements and set meta.keyword_overrides=true while returning the corrected sets in meta.primary_keywords/secondary_keywords/lsi_terms.

PLATFORM RULES (Instagram Post):
- Goal: a single, **compelling visual** + a **micro-blog caption**.
- Caption: 150‚Äì200 words preferred (accept 120‚Äì200); first line must **hook** (avoid "click more" bait); add 1 clear CTA; weave primary/secondary/LSI naturally (no stuffing).
- Hashtags: EXACTLY 30 (mix broad + niche + micro-niche + intent + branded if present). Provide both:
  - a flat `hashtags` array (30),
  - and `hashtags_grouped` by reach tier (for moderation/analytics).
- Location tag: suggest up to 3 relevant locations (event, city, virtual) or return [] if not applicable.
- Visual: if images enabled, produce **2 variants (A & B)** with detailed prompts; maintain 4:5 ratio, 1080√ó1350.

INSTAGRAM POST ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025 - CRITICAL):
- Instagram prioritizes: **SAVES > Shares > Comments > Likes** for reach (saves are 10x more valuable)
- Target metrics: 5%+ save rate, 3%+ share rate, 2%+ comment rate
- First 3 seconds CRITICAL: Visual must stop scroll in feed (80% of users decide within 3s)
- Engagement rate formula: (Saves + Shares + Comments) / Followers x 100
- Caption first line: First 125 characters visible before "...more" (pack value here)
- Posting time: Tuesday-Thursday 11AM-1PM or 7-9PM (tech audience peak engagement)
- Hashtags: 20-30 optimal, EXACT formula: 10 small (<100K) + 15 medium (100K-1M) + 5 large (1M+)
- Hashtag strategy: First 3-5 most important for discovery (Instagram reads these first)
- Location tags: Increase local discoverability by 30% (use city/event/virtual tags)
- Alt text: Helps accessibility + SEO indexing (Instagram reads for ranking)
- Saves trigger: Educational/valuable content = high saves = reach multiplier effect
- Comments: Reply to first 10-20 comments within 1 hour (strong engagement signal to algorithm)
- Profile optimization: Bio link + story highlights convert viewers to followers
- Feed format: 4:5 ratio performs 20% better than square (more screen real estate)
- Carousel vs Single: Single post = faster consumption = better for quick insights/stats
- Repost prevention: Original content favored, reposted content gets 50% less reach
- Video vs Image: Images still perform better for educational tech content (easier to save/screenshot)

# üìù CAPTION STRUCTURE (WORLD-CLASS - FOLLOW EXACTLY):
For maximum engagement, saves, and reach, follow this exact 7-section structure:

CAPTION FORMAT:
[HOOK] (First 125 characters - appears before "...more")

‚Ü≥ Question that sparks discussion
‚Ü≥ Examples: "What's your approach? üëá", "Have you faced this? Let me know! üí¨", "Which method do you use? Comment below! üí≠"

[CTA + LINK] (1-2 lines)
‚Ü≥ Multi-layered CTA: Save üîñ for later + Follow @{handle} for more + Share üì≤ with your team
‚Ü≥ Link with UTM: "{primary_url}?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=post"

[HASHTAGS] (30 hashtags, space-separated on new lines)
‚Ü≥ EXACT Mix: 10 small (<100K) + 15 medium (100K-1M) + 5 large (1M+)
‚Ü≥ No banned/spam tags; localized when appropriate
‚Ü≥ First 3-5 hashtags most important for discovery
