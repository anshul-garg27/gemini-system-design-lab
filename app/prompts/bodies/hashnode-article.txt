SET: platform="hashnode", format="article", prompt_version="hashnode-article-1.3"
WRITING CUES: SEO-optimized; developer-focused; runnable code; diagrams; TOC; series-friendly; topic-adaptive; practical examples.

IMAGES REQUIRED: optional 1 cover (1200×630, 1.91:1) by default.

- options: { "include_images": true, "max_length_levels":"standard", "variance_seed":"default", "length_hint": 1800 }  // word target

# OPTIONAL — SEO (auto-correct allowed; set keyword_overrides=true if corrected)
- seo: { "primary_keywords": [], "secondary_keywords": [], "lsi_terms": [] }

# NEW (optional) — multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 1,                                      # default 1; allowed 0–3

    ],
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C)."
  }

# NEW — topic-agnostic taxonomy (for tags/SEO)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate terms:
   broad(3–5), niche(3–5), micro_niche(3–5), intent(1–2), branded(0–1).
   Localize to {locale} when natural. Lowercase; hyphenate multi-word."

PLATFORM RULES (Hashnode Article):
- Length: 1500–3000 words.
- Title: SEO-optimized ≤60 chars; slug URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphenated).
- Structure: Intro → **Table of Contents** → 4–7 H2 sections (with optional H3s) → Conclusion + CTA.
- Include at least **2 code snippets** and **1 diagram block** (Mermaid or ASCII) with alt text.
- Series potential: indicate whether this could be Part 1; suggest 2–3 follow-ups.
- Canonical URL: set to {primary_url} if republishing; else "".
- Tags: 5–6 relevant, lowercase; Hashnode style.
- CTA: one tracked link if {primary_url} present: "{primary_url}?{brand.utm_base}" used once in body.

HASHNODE ALGORITHM & DISCOVERY OPTIMIZATION (2025):
- Hashnode prioritizes: Featured tag selection > Reactions (❤️) > Comments > Bookmarks
- Featured tags: Articles with popular tags get distributed to tag followers
- Reactions: Heart reactions = engagement signal
- Reading time: 6-10 min articles = optimal engagement
- Code snippets: Increase time on page (SEO signal)
- Series: Multi-part series = subscriber retention
- Community: Hashnode network effects (followers see posts)
- SEO: Google indexes Hashnode articles well (good domain authority)
- Tags: First 3 tags most important for discovery
- TOC: Table of Contents = better UX = lower bounce
- Canonical: Can republish from own blog

HASHNODE ARTICLE PSYCHOLOGY:
- Title formulas (≤60 chars):
  * Tutorial: "Building a Scalable Redis Cache: A Complete Guide"
  * Deep dive: "Inside Netflix's System Architecture: 7 Key Patterns"
  * Problem/Solution: "Fixing Slow Database Queries: A Practical Approach"
  * How I: "How I Optimized Our API to Handle 1M Requests/Sec"
  * Comparison: "GraphQL vs REST: When to Use Each (With Examples)"
- Structure:
  * Intro with problem statement
  * TOC (Hashnode auto-generates but provide structure)
  * Background/prerequisites
  * Core explanation with diagrams
  * Implementation with code
  * Trade-offs/pitfalls
  * Real-world case
  * Conclusion with next steps
- Code snippets:
  * Must be runnable
  * Include setup commands
  * Add comments explaining logic
  * Show expected output
- Series strategy:
  * Part 1: Fundamentals
  * Part 2: Implementation
  * Part 3: Advanced patterns
  * Part 4: Production deployment

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Hashnode Format):
- DSA: Problem → brute force → optimization → code with tests → complexity → variations → practice links
- System Design: Requirements → architecture v1 → bottlenecks → architecture v2 → code/config → metrics → lessons
- Programming: Challenge → investigation → solution → runnable code → testing → refactoring → best practices
- AI/ML: Problem → model selection → training code → hyperparameters → results → deployment → monitoring
- Database: Issue → query analysis → optimization → SQL code → before/after → indexing → guidelines
- DevOps: Challenge → solution design → automation code → implementation → monitoring → results → checklist
- Interview: Question → approach → solution → complete code → test cases → optimization → similar problems

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (image prompts):
- Aesthetic: minimalist editorial-tech; off-white/light bg; thin vector strokes; subtle grid; one restrained accent color; generous margins; flat vector; no stock photos.
- Negative prompt baseline: "no clutter, no stock-photo people, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no glossy gradients, no fake UI chrome".
- Safe margins: keep title elements ≥48 px from edges on 1200×630.

VALIDATION:
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned.

- Tags array length MUST be 5–6; lowercase; topic-appropriate.
- Slug must be lowercase, hyphenated, URL-safe.
- If {primary_url} non-empty → set canonical_url and include exactly one tracked CTA link in body.
- When options.include_images=true:
  - If `image_plan.count` provided → `image_prompts` MUST contain EXACTLY that many items using roles in order A,B,(C).
  - Else → `image_prompts` MUST contain exactly 1 item (cover, 1200×630).
- If SEO sets were auto-corrected, set `meta.keyword_overrides=true` and return corrected sets.
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
