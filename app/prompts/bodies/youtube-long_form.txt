# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (YOUTUBE LONG-FORM):
⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST generate 6-10 IMAGES (16:9 ratio, 1280x720). This is NOT optional.

CORE IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - MANDATORY):
1. "thumb_a" - Text-heavy thumbnail with 2-word punch + metric (A/B test variant A)
2. "thumb_b" - Diagram-heavy thumbnail with architecture flow (A/B test variant B)

VIDEO OVERLAY IMAGES (GENERATE 4-8 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED):
3. "chapter_intro" - Chapter marker card with title + number (overlay at chapter starts)
4. "diagram_hero" - Hero architecture/flow diagram (main concept explanation)
5. "stat_card" - Performance metrics dashboard (key numbers overlay)
6. "code_snippet" - Syntax-highlighted code card (implementation example)
7. "comparison_chart" - Side-by-side A vs B comparison (trade-offs section)
8. "before_after" - Before/After transformation card (problem/solution)
9. "timeline_flow" - Process timeline with stages (step-by-step breakdown)
10. "quote_card" - Typographic key insight card (memorable takeaway)

TOTAL IMAGES: 6-10 images (16:9 ratio, 1280x720) - YouTube thumbnail optimized (readable at 246x138px preview), video overlay ready, chapter marker compatible

INPUT VARIABLES (provided by caller):
- topic_id: "{topic_id}"
- topic_title: "{topic_name}"
- topic_description: """{topic_description}"""
- audience: "{audience}"
- tone: "{tone}"

    "utm_base":"utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=long"
  }
- options: { "include_images": true, "max_length_levels":"standard", "variance_seed":"default", "length_hint": 10 }  // length_hint in minutes

# OPTIONAL — SEO (if placeholders don't match the topic, you MAY auto-correct and set keyword_overrides=true)
- seo: { "primary_keywords": [], "secondary_keywords": [], "lsi_terms": [] }

# NEW (optional) — multi-image control (kept default behavior if omitted)
- image_plan: {
    "count": 2,                                      # default 2; allowed 2–4

    "size_px": "1280x720",
    "notes": "Return exactly `image_plan.count` items using roles in order A,B,(C..)."
  }

# NEW — topic-agnostic taxonomy (for tags/chapters phrasing)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate terms:
   broad(3–5), niche(3–5), micro_niche(3–5), intent(1–2), branded(0–1).
   Localize to {locale} when natural. Lowercase; no spaces."

PLATFORM RULES (YouTube Long-form):
- Total duration target: 8–12 minutes (sweet spot for retention).
- Mandatory beats: Intro hook (0–15s) → Background (context) → Architecture/Mechanics → Trade-offs/Pitfalls → Case study → Summary & CTA (+ End screen).
- Provide both an **outline** and a **script** with time ranges.
- Chapters: 6–10 chapters with timestamps [mm:ss] starting at 0:00; names must match outline sections.
- Visual guidance: screen recording notes, b-roll plan, graphics list (diagrams, overlays), lower-thirds, music mood, and SFX (optional).
- Description: ≥500 words, SEO-optimized, includes chapter timestamps, value bullets, and ONE tracked link "{primary_url}?{brand.utm_base}" if primary_url is present (otherwise omit).
- Thumbnails: return detailed prompts for two 16:9 designs (A/B); flat vector, high contrast; no faces or logos.

YOUTUBE ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025 - CRITICAL):
- YouTube prioritizes: **AVERAGE VIEW DURATION (AVD) > Click-Through Rate (CTR) > Likes/Comments > Shares**
- **First 30 seconds CRITICAL**: 50% drop-off point → hook must capture IMMEDIATELY with concrete benefit/number
- **Average View Duration (AVD)**: Target 50%+ (4-6 min for 8-12 min video), industry average 35-45%
- **Target metrics**: 50%+ AVD, 8-12% CTR, 4%+ like rate, 2%+ comment rate, 1%+ share rate
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Target 8-12% for tech content (thumbnail + title combo CRITICAL)
- **Retention curve shape**: Strong hook (0-15s) → dip at 30s (expected) → maintain 40-60% middle → spike at end (preview next)
- **Chapter markers CRITICAL**: Boost retention 15-20% (viewers navigate, algorithm rewards structured content)
- **End screen**: Last 20s adds 10-15% to session watch time (suggests next video, keeps viewer on platform)
- **Posting time**: Tuesday-Thursday 2-4PM ET or Saturday 10AM-12PM ET (peak tech audience engagement)
- **Video length**: 8-12 min optimal (8 min = minimum for mid-roll ads, 12 min = sweet spot before drop-off, 15+ min = completion drops)
- **SEO optimization**: Title first 3 words (search weight), description first 2 lines (search preview), tags top 5 (discovery)
- **Thumbnail psychology**: High contrast colors = 2x attention, readable at 246x138px preview = critical, clear focal point = essential
- **Engagement boost**: Pin comment with question = 3x more comments, heart first 10 comments = 2x engagement, reply within 1 hour = algorithm boost
- **Video retention hooks**: Visual change every 30-45 seconds (retention anchor), numbered points (progress tracking), teaser at 80% (completion incentive)
- **Session time optimization**: End screen links (2-3 videos) = +25% session time, playlist recommendation = +40% session time
- **A/B testing**: Upload 2 thumbnails, YouTube auto-tests, winner gets more impressions (always provide 2 variants)
- **Suggested videos**: First 48 hours critical (20% of all-time views), high CTR + AVD = more suggestions

# 🎯 YOUTUBE LONG-FORM PSYCHOLOGY (AVD OPTIMIZED - 7 HOOK FORMULAS):

**HOOK FORMULA 1 - Problem + Number (Pain Amplification):**
- Format: "Your [system] is [doing X inefficiency]. Here's why:"
- Examples: "Your database is doing 10,000 unnecessary queries. Here's why:", "Your API makes 47 network calls per request. Let's fix it:", "Your cache misses 80% of requests. This is the problem:"
- Why it works: Quantifies pain (specific number = credibility), creates urgency, promises immediate solution
- Retention trigger: Viewer checks "Is MY system doing this?" self-audit urgency
- Target: 55%+ AVD from problem recognition

**HOOK FORMULA 2 - Shocking Reveal (Contrarian Expertise):**
- Format: "I found a [metric] solution everyone says is [worse metric]"
- Examples: "I found an O(n) solution everyone says is O(n log n)", "This 'slow' approach is 10x faster in production", "The inefficient method beats the optimized one"
- Why it works: Challenges conventional wisdom, positions you as expert who knows better
- Retention trigger: Cognitive dissonance = must know why/how
- Target: High comment rate from debate

**HOOK FORMULA 3 - Curiosity Gap (Impossible Result):**
- Format: "This one [X] trick handles [impossibly large number]"
- Examples: "This one Redis trick handles 1 billion requests per second", "One index speeds up queries 1000x", "This caching strategy eliminated 99% of DB calls"
- Why it works: Creates "how is that possible?" gap, concrete number = concrete curiosity
- Retention trigger: Pattern completion need (must know the trick)
- Target: 60%+ AVD from curiosity pull

**HOOK FORMULA 4 - Mistake Expose (Vulnerability + Authority):**
- Format: "Everyone implements this wrong. Including me. Here's the fix:"
- Examples: "Everyone implements auth wrong. Including me. Here's the fix:", "We all make this caching mistake. Cost me $20K:", "This common pattern breaks at scale. I learned the hard way:"
- Why it works: Vulnerability = relatability, authority = "I've been there", promises redemption
- Retention trigger: "Am I making this mistake?" self-check fear
- Target: High save rate (want to remember fix)

**HOOK FORMULA 5 - Result Tease (Social Proof + Transformation):**
- Format: "How [Company] reduced [metric] from [bad] to [good]. Let's break it down."
- Examples: "How Netflix reduced latency from 500ms to 5ms. Let's break it down:", "How Uber scales to 1M requests per second. Architecture breakdown:", "How Discord handles 1B messages per day. System design:"
- Why it works: Social proof (big company), concrete transformation (specific metrics), clear value promise
- Retention trigger: "I want those results" aspiration
- Target: High share rate (impressive to share)

**HOOK FORMULA 6 - Tutorial Promise (Skill Acquisition):**
- Format: "Build [impressive thing] in [short time]. Step by step."
- Examples: "Build a distributed cache in 12 minutes. Step by step.", "Design Twitter's architecture from scratch. Complete walkthrough:", "Implement JWT auth properly. No shortcuts:"
- Why it works: Concrete deliverable, time commitment stated, educational value clear
- Retention trigger: Skill acquisition motivation
- Target: 65%+ AVD from tutorial completion drive

**HOOK FORMULA 7 - Comparison Reveal (Decision Support):**
- Format: "[A] vs [B]: I tested both. Here's what I found."
- Examples: "REST vs GraphQL: I tested both for 6 months. Here's what I found:", "SQL vs NoSQL: When to use which. Real benchmarks:", "Microservices vs Monolith: I ran both in production:"
- Why it works: Addresses common decision paralysis, promises data-driven answer, personal experience
- Retention trigger: Decision-making urgency (actively choosing)
- Target: High save rate (reference material)

## YOUTUBE LONG-FORM STRUCTURE (8-12 MIN - AVD OPTIMIZED):

**0-15s (Hook - 50% Drop-Off Point):**
- **ONE of 7 hook formulas** with concrete number/benefit
- Visual: Punch-in title + immediate diagram preview
- Audio: Start narration IMMEDIATELY (no intro music)
- On-screen text: Hook text visible (8-10 words max)
- **CRITICAL**: If you lose them here, video dies

**15s-2min (Background - Context Setup):**
- "Before we dive in, you need to know 3 things..." (numbered setup)
- Avoid jargon overload (lose audience if too technical too fast)
- Show "why this matters" early (relevance anchor)
- Visual: Simple diagram intro, lower-third definitions
- Hook to next: "Now here's how it works:"

**2-6min (Architecture/Mechanics - Core Value):**
- Use numbered points ("First...", "Second...", "Third...") for progress tracking
- Visual aids EVERY 30-45 seconds (retention anchor, prevents drop-off)
- Code examples 3-7 lines max (longer = screen recording with commentary)
- Diagram overlays at 2:30, 3:45, 5:00 (visual rhythm)
- Hook to next: "But there's a catch:"

**6-8min (Trade-Offs - Credibility Builder):**
- "Nothing is perfect. Here's what you sacrifice:"
- Honest pros/cons comparison (builds trust)
- When to use / when NOT to use (nuanced expertise)
- Visual: Comparison chart overlay at 6:30
- Hook to next: "Here's how companies handle this in production:"

**8-10min (Case Study - Social Proof):**
- Real company example ("Netflix/Uber/Google uses this for...")
- Specific numbers ("Reduced by 80%", "Handles 1M QPS", "$50K saved")
- Architecture diagram of real implementation
- Visual: Company architecture overlay at 8:45
- Hook to end: "Let's wrap this up with key takeaways:"

**10-12min (Conclusion - Reinforce + Session Time):**
- 3 key takeaways (numbered, repeat from intro)
- Clear next step ("Try this approach", "Check the article")
- End screen preview: "If you want to dive deeper, watch this next:"
- Visual: Takeaway cards at 10:30, 11:00, 11:30
- **CRITICAL**: Last 20s = end screen (adds 10-15% session time)

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Long-form):
- DSA/Algorithms: Problem → Brute force → Optimization → Complexity analysis → Visualization
- System Design: Requirements → Architecture → Component deep-dive → Scale considerations → Trade-offs
- Programming: Problem → Basic solution → Refactoring → Best practices → Testing
- AI/ML: Problem → Model architecture → Training process → Hyperparameters → Results
- Database: Problem → Schema design → Query optimization → Indexing → Performance
- DevOps: Problem → Pipeline setup → Automation → Monitoring → Best practices
- Interview Prep: Question → Approach → Solution → Edge cases → Follow-ups

## ENGAGEMENT TACTICS (YOUTUBE LONG-FORM SPECIFIC):

**AVD Optimization (Average View Duration):**
- Hook strength: First 15s determines 50% of retention (concrete number + clear benefit)
- Visual rhythm: Change visual EVERY 30-45 seconds (diagram, code, screen recording, overlay)
- Progress tracking: Numbered points ("First...", "Second...") = viewers track completion
- Chapter markers: 15-20% retention boost (viewers navigate, algorithm rewards structure)
- Retention anchors: Preview next section at end of current ("Now here's the trade-off:")
- Completion incentive: Tease best insight at 80% ("The most important part comes at the end:")

**CTR Optimization (Click-Through Rate - Thumbnail + Title):**
- Thumbnail psychology: High contrast (readable at 246x138px), clear focal point, 2-word punch text
- A/B testing: Always provide 2 thumbnail variants (text-heavy vs diagram-heavy)
- Title optimization: First 3 words carry search weight (front-load primary keyword)
- Curiosity gap: Title + thumbnail create "must know" tension
- Number inclusion: Concrete metrics in title/thumbnail = 1.5x CTR boost
- Target: 8-12% CTR for tech content (industry average 4-6%)

**Chapter Strategy (15-20% Retention Boost):**
- 6-10 chapters optimal (more = too granular, fewer = not enough structure)
- Timestamps start at 0:00 (required for algorithm recognition)
- Names match outline sections (consistency)
- Strategic naming: "Problem", "Solution", "Trade-offs", "Case Study" (action-oriented)
- Algorithm boost: Structured content = higher recommendations

**Visual Retention Anchors:**
- Diagram overlays: 2:30, 3:45, 5:00, 6:30, 8:45, 10:30 (every 1-2 minutes)
- Code overlays: 3-7 lines max (longer = screen recording with commentary)
- Comparison charts: Trade-offs section (6-8 min) builds credibility
- Lower-thirds: Definition callouts for jargon (prevents confusion drop-off)
- B-roll rhythm: Screen recording 30%, diagrams 30%, talking head 20%, overlays 20%

**Engagement Triggers:**
- Pin comment with question = 3x more comments ("What's your approach?", "Agree or disagree?")
- Heart first 10 comments within 1 hour = 2x engagement (algorithm boost)
- Timestamps in description = easier navigation = higher retention
- Mid-roll CTA at 5min: "If this helps, hit like so more devs see it" (like rate boost)
- End screen CTA: "For the deep dive, check this out:" (session time boost)

**Session Time Optimization (Critical for Algorithm):**
- End screen: Last 20s adds 10-15% to session time
- Suggested videos: 2-3 related videos (avoid leaving YouTube)
- Playlist recommendation: "Full series here:" = +40% session time
- Next video preview: "If you want to learn [X], watch this next" (verbal hook to end screen)

**SEO Strategy (Discovery Optimization):**
- Title first 3 words: Carry most search weight (primary keyword here)
- Description first 2 lines: Show in search preview (include hook text)
- Tags top 5: Most important for discovery (primary + secondary keywords)
- Chapter timestamps in description: Boost structured content signals
- Keyword density: Primary keyword 3-5 times in description naturally

**First 48 Hours Strategy (20% of All-Time Views):**
- High CTR + AVD in first 48 hours = algorithm pushes to suggested videos
- Community post/story: Drive initial traffic (YouTube rewards cross-promotion)
- Pin comment immediately: Start conversation thread
- Reply to first 20 comments: Engagement signal to algorithm
- Share to relevant subreddit/community: Initial velocity critical

**Credibility Signals:**
- Specific numbers: Not rounded ($4,873 not $5K, 1,847 QPS not 2K)
- Company names: Real examples (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb) build social proof
- Time invested: "Spent 3 months", "Analyzed 1000 cases" = data authority
- Honest trade-offs: "Here's when NOT to use this" = nuanced expertise
- Personal experience: "I made this mistake, cost me $20K" = vulnerability + authority

**Target Metrics (Track These):**
- **AVD**: 50%+ (4-6 min for 8-12 min video), industry average 35-45%
- **CTR**: 8-12% for tech content (thumbnail + title combo)
- **Like rate**: 4%+ of views (mid-roll CTA at 5min helps)
- **Comment rate**: 2%+ of views (pin question helps)
- **Share rate**: 1%+ (impressive results/insights)
- **Session time**: Watch next video = +25%, playlist = +40%
- **Retention curve**: Hook strong (85%+) → dip at 30s (60%+) → maintain 40-60% → spike at end (70%+)

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (16:9 Thumbnails):
