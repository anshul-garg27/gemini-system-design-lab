# API Health Check Fix

## Problem
The API health checker was showing "quota exceeded" error for all API keys even though the APIs were working fine.

## Root Cause
1. **Wrong GeminiClient**: The health check was importing `app.gemini_client.GeminiClient` which requires `google.generativeai` package that's not installed
2. **Incorrect error detection**: Any error containing the word "limit" was being classified as "quota exceeded"
3. **Module not found**: The app/gemini_client.py couldn't be imported due to missing dependency

## Solution
1. **Updated import**: Changed to use the root `gemini_client.GeminiClient` which uses `requests` library
2. **Adapted health check**: Modified to work with the root GeminiClient's API (generate_topics instead of generate_content)
3. **Better error handling**: More specific error detection to avoid false "quota exceeded" classifications
4. **Simplified testing**: Since root GeminiClient uses a queue system, we test the default configuration only

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Fix
```python
# Before
from .gemini_client import GeminiClient  # app/gemini_client.py

# After  
from gemini_client import GeminiClient   # root gemini_client.py
```

### 2. Health Check Method
```python
# Now uses generate_topics with a test topic
result = client.generate_topics(
    topics=[{"id": 99999, "title": "Test API Health Check"}],
    all_topic_ids=[99999],
    created_date="2024-01-01",
    updated_date="2024-01-01"
)
```

### 3. Error Detection
```python
# More specific checks
if "429" in error_str or "rate limit" in error_str.lower():
    status = "rate_limited"
elif "quota" in error_str.lower() and "exceeded" in error_str.lower():
    status = "quota_exceeded"  # Only if both words present
elif "403" in error_str or "401" in error_str:
    status = "error"
    error_message = "Authentication error"
```

## New Capabilities (Updated!)
‚úÖ **Now tests ALL configured API keys individually**
- Loads all API keys from `config.py` (75+ keys!) or environment variable
- Tests each key separately to show individual health status
- Provides detailed per-key status and error messages
- Maintains minimal API quota usage by testing with simple requests

## How to Use

### 1. Check All API Keys
```bash
# From frontend
Visit: http://localhost:3000/health

# Or via API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/check
```

### 2. Check Specific API Key
```bash
# Test key at index 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/health/test-key?key_index=0
```

### 3. Get API Key Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/stats
```

### 4. Run Test Script
```bash
python3 test_all_api_keys.py
```

## Results You'll See
- ‚úÖ **Healthy** - API key is working fine
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Rate Limited** - Too many requests, wait a bit
- üìä **Quota Exceeded** - Monthly quota reached
- ‚ùå **Error** - Invalid key or other issues

## Implementation Details
- Each API key is tested with a minimal topic generation request
- Tests run concurrently for faster results
- Detailed error messages help identify specific issues
- Works with your existing 75+ API keys configuration
