# DYNAMIC IMAGE GENERATION RULES:
- Analyze the topic complexity and content depth to determine optimal image count (1-3 images)
- Choose appropriate image roles based on what best serves the content:
  * Always include: "background" (required)
  * Choose from: "pattern_background", "broll_bg"
- All images: ratio "9:16", size "1080x1920"
- Return your chosen count and roles in the meta.image_plan object

# NEW (generic topic taxonomy; if your provided SEO lists are placeholders, you MAY auto-correct them)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate tags when necessary:
   broad(3–5), niche(4–6), micro_niche(3–5), intent(2–3), branded(0–1).
   Use locale when natural. Lowercase; no spaces (camelCase/underscores ok)."

AUTO-CORRECTION RULE (safe):
- If provided SEO keywords obviously do not match {topic_title}/The Arrow Code anti-pattern refers to deeply nested conditional logic (if/else statements) that severely reduces code readability and increases cognitive load. Learn to recognize this code smell and apply refactoring techniques like Guard Clauses, early returns, and the Strategy Pattern to flatten the code structure., infer replacements and set meta.keyword_overrides=true while returning the corrected sets in meta.primary_keywords/secondary_keywords/lsi_terms.

PLATFORM RULES (Instagram Story):
- 3–5 story frames, each ~15s.
- Frames: 1 Hook → 2 Micro-insight (use poll or quiz) → 3 CTA (add countdown or link).
- Keep copy tight (Hook ≤12 words; Insight ≤14; CTA ≤10). High-contrast, mobile-safe.
- Include interactive stickers suggestions per frame (poll/question/quiz/countdown/link).
- Link strategy: if https://example.com/topic/16267 present → provide swipe/link text + UTM "https://example.com/topic/16267?{brand.utm_base}", else omit link.
- Time-sensitive angle: propose urgency (e.g., "only this week," "drop at 6 PM").
- Visual style: text-first; optional soft background if images enabled.
- Image plan (if options.include_images=true):
  - Analyze topic complexity and determine optimal image count (1-3 images)
  - Always include "background" as first image
  - Choose additional roles based on content needs: pattern_background, broll_bg
  - Return exactly the number you determine is optimal for this specific topic

INSTAGRAM STORY ALGORITHM & ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION (2025):
- Instagram Stories prioritize: Replies > Shares > Taps forward > Completion rate
- First 3 seconds CRITICAL: Must hook or they'll swipe away
- Interactive stickers: Boost reach by 20-30% (polls, quizzes, questions)
- Replies: DM conversations = highest engagement signal
- Completion rate: All frames viewed = algorithm boost
- Taps: Forward taps reduce reach, backward taps = positive
- Shares: Story shares to DMs = viral potential
- Links: Swipe-up links (10K+ followers) or link stickers
- Posting time: Stories have 24h lifespan, post during peak hours
- Story highlights: Save to highlights for evergreen discovery
- Close friends: Exclusive content drives loyalty

INSTAGRAM STORY PSYCHOLOGY:
- Frame structure (3-5 frames):
  * Frame 1: Hook (stop the thumb)
  * Frame 2: Value (why they should care)
  * Frame 3: Interaction (poll/quiz)
  * Frame 4: Depth (extra insight)
  * Frame 5: CTA (link/follow)
- Copy rules:
  * Hook: ≤12 words (3 seconds to read)
  * Insight: ≤14 words (attention span)
  * CTA: ≤10 words (clear action)
  * High contrast (readable in sunlight)
- Interactive stickers:
  * Polls: Binary choice (This or That?)
  * Quizzes: 2-4 options (test knowledge)
  * Questions: Open-ended (spark DMs)
  * Sliders: Emoji reactions (quick feedback)
  * Countdown: FOMO (limited time)
  * Link: Swipe-up (10K+) or link sticker
- Engagement tactics:
  * Ask questions
  * Use polls
  * Create urgency
  * Behind-the-scenes
  * Quick tips

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Story Format):
- DSA: Hook ("This algorithm trick") → Problem visual → Poll (complexity?) → Solution → CTA (practice link)
- System Design: Hook ("How [company] scaled") → Architecture visual → Quiz (bottleneck?) → Solution → CTA (deep-dive link)
- Programming: Hook ("[Language] mistake") → Bad code → Poll (spot the bug?) → Fixed code → CTA (learn more)
- AI/ML: Hook ("Improved accuracy by [X]%") → Approach visual → Slider (difficulty?) → Results → CTA (tutorial link)
- Database: Hook ("[X]x faster queries") → Slow query → Quiz (optimization?) → Fast query → CTA (guide link)
- DevOps: Hook ("Automated deployment") → Manual process → Poll (time wasted?) → Automated → CTA (setup link)
- Interview: Hook ("Cracked [X] interviews") → Framework → Question (your approach?) → Tips → CTA (prep link)

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS:
- Aesthetic: elegant, minimalist, off-white background; thin vector strokes; subtle grid; one restrained accent color; generous margins; high contrast labels; no drop shadows or faux 3D.
- Negative prompt baseline for images: "no busy texture, no clutter, no photoreal faces, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no fake UI chrome, no stock icon noise".
- Safe margins: keep text ≥96 px from edges (1080x1920).

TASK:
Generate Instagram Story sequence for topic: Recognizing and Refactoring the Arrow Code Anti-Pattern
Context: The Arrow Code anti-pattern refers to deeply nested conditional logic (if/else statements) that severely reduces code readability and increases cognitive load. Learn to recognize this code smell and apply refactoring techniques like Guard Clauses, early returns, and the Strategy Pattern to flatten the code structure.

Requirements:
- 3-5 story frames (15 seconds each)
- Interactive elements (polls, questions, quizzes)
- Swipe-up/link sticker strategy
- Time-sensitive content angle
- Behind-the-scenes or quick tip format

VALIDATION:
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned.
- Total frames between 3 and 5.
- Each frame includes copy (within limits), at least one sticker idea, alt_text, and duration_seconds.
- If https://example.com/topic/16267 is empty → stickers.link_strategy.enabled=false and no link in copy.
- When options.include_images=true:
  - Analyze the topic and determine optimal image count (1-3 images)
  - Set meta.image_plan.count to your chosen number and populate roles array
  - Generate exactly that many image_prompts with appropriate roles
  - Provide reasoning in meta.image_plan.reasoning for your choice
- If you auto-correct SEO keywords, set `meta.keyword_overrides=true` and return corrected sets.
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
