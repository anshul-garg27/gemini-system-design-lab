# DYNAMIC IMAGE GENERATION RULES:
- Analyze the topic complexity and content depth to determine optimal image count (2-10 images)
- Choose appropriate image roles based on what best serves the content:
  * Always include: "cover" (required)
  * Choose from: "architecture_panel", "stat_card", "before_after", "quote_card", "checklist_card", "flow_diagram", "comparison_chart"
- All images: ratio "4:5", size "1080x1350"
- Return your chosen count and roles in the meta.image_plan object

# NEW (generic topic taxonomy; if your provided SEO lists are placeholders, you MAY auto-correct them)
- keyword_tiers_policy:
  "Derive topic-appropriate tags when necessary:
   broad(5–7), niche(8–10), micro_niche(6–10), intent(3–5), branded(0–2).
   Use locale when natural. Lowercase; no spaces (camelCase/underscores ok)."

AUTO-CORRECTION RULE (safe):
- If provided SEO keywords obviously do not match {topic_title}/The Arrow Code anti-pattern refers to deeply nested conditional logic (if/else statements) that severely reduces code readability and increases cognitive load. Learn to recognize this code smell and apply refactoring techniques like Guard Clauses, early returns, and the Strategy Pattern to flatten the code structure., infer replacements and set meta.keyword_overrides=true while returning the corrected sets in meta.primary_keywords/secondary_keywords/lsi_terms.

PLATFORM RULES (Instagram Carousel):
- Preferred ratio: 4:5 (1080x1350). Max 10 slides; aim 8–10.
- Slide roles: 1 Hook → 2 Problem → 3 Core Idea → 4 Architecture/Deep Dive → 5 Trade-offs → 6 Metrics → 7 Mini-case → 8 Summary → 9–10 CTA/Bonus (use 10 only if needed).
- Bullet length ≤14 words; 1 idea per bullet. Title ≤8–10 words. Subtitle ≤14 words.
- Each slide MUST include: title, subtitle, bullets[], overlay_text, design_note, layout, iconography, contrast_notes, alt_text.
- Caption must be SEO-aware (200–300 words), naturally weaving primary/secondary keywords (no stuffing), tasteful emojis, 1 CTA with shortened link placeholder: "https://example.com/topic/16267?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=carousel".
- Provide EXACTLY 30 hashtags: mix broad + niche + topic-specific; no repeats/banned tags. (Build from keyword_tiers if you auto-correct.)
- Image plan (if options.include_images=true):
  - Analyze topic complexity and determine optimal image count (2-10 images)
  - Always include "cover" as first image
  - Choose additional roles based on content needs: architecture_panel, stat_card, before_after, quote_card, checklist_card, flow_diagram, comparison_chart
  - Return exactly the number you determine is optimal for this specific topic

INSTAGRAM ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025):
- Instagram prioritizes SAVES > Shares > Likes > Comments for reach
- Carousel format: Higher completion rate (people swiping to last slide) = better reach
- Hook slide (slide 1): Must stop scroll in <0.8 seconds
- First 3 slides critical: If user doesn't swipe by slide 3, they won't finish
- Optimal slides: 8-10 (lower completion rate with 10, but more value = more saves)
- Posting time: Tuesday-Thursday 10AM-2PM or 7-9PM (tech audience active)
- Caption: First 125 characters appear before "... more" - pack value there
- Hashtags: Mix of small (<100K), medium (100K-1M), large (1M+) for best reach
- Call-to-action: "Save this for later 🔖" performs 3x better than "Like if you agree"

PSYCHOLOGICAL ENGAGEMENT (Carousel-Specific):
- Slide 1 Hook formulas (choose based on topic):
  * Number promise: "5 Redis Patterns That Handle 1B+ Keys"
  * Curiosity gap: "Everyone uses X wrong. Here's why:"
  * Contrarian: "Stop doing {common practice}. Do this instead:"
  * Result-driven: "From O(n²) to O(n log n) in 3 Steps"
  * Problem-agitation: "Your database is slow. Here's the hidden cause:"
- Slide 2 Problem: Amplify pain with specific numbers ("costs $10K/month", "wastes 5 hours/week")
- Slide 3 Core Idea: "But here's what changed everything..." (cliffhanger before solution)
- Slide 4 Architecture: ADAPT to topic type - flowchart for DSA, components for systems, code for programming
- Slide 5 Trade-offs: Build trust by showing both sides honestly
- Slide 6 Metrics: One HERO number that's impressive (10x, 99.9%, sub-ms)
- Slide 7 Case: Real company example for credibility ("Netflix uses this for...")
- Slide 8 Summary: 3 numbered takeaways (easier to remember + implement)
- Slide 9-10 CTA: Layer multiple CTAs - "Save 🔖 + Share with your team 📲 + Link in bio for full guide"

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC:
- DSA/Algorithms: Focus on complexity, visual algorithm steps, "aha moment" revelation
- System Design: Component diagrams, scale numbers (handles X QPS), trade-off tables
- Programming: Code snippets (keep to 5-7 lines max), debugging tips, language-specific gotchas
- AI/ML: Model architecture visual, accuracy improvements, training time comparisons
- Database: Query examples, index strategy, before/after performance
- DevOps: Pipeline flows, deployment strategies, monitoring metrics
- Interview Prep: Common mistakes, what interviewers look for, example answers

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (All Tech Topics):
- Aesthetic: elegant, minimalist, tech-diagram/whiteboard vibe; ADAPT to topic domain
- Topic-appropriate visuals:
  * System Design/HLD: Component boxes with arrows, service interactions, data flow
  * DSA/Algorithms: Tree/graph structures, array visualizations, Big-O notation prominently
  * Programming: Code blocks (5-7 lines max), syntax highlighting, file/folder structure
  * AI/ML/DL: Neural network layers, training curves, confusion matrix, model architecture
  * Database: Table schemas, query execution plans, index b-trees, ER relationships
  * DevOps: Pipeline stages, container flows, monitoring graphs, deployment diagram
  * Interview Prep: Checklist format, do/don't comparisons, mistake highlights
- Color palette by domain:
  * Backend/Systems: Blue (#2563EB), Cyan (#06B6D4), Slate (#0F172A)
  * Frontend/Web: Orange (#F97316), Yellow (#FACC15), Amber (#F59E0B)

- Background: Off-white (#F8F7F4 or #FAFAFA) for Instagram feed compatibility
- Typography: Geometric sans (Outfit, Inter, DM Sans) for headlines; monospace (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code) for code/metrics
- Text hierarchy: Headlines 80-120px, subtitles 40-60px, body 28-36px, captions 20-24px
- Negative prompt baseline: "no clutter, no busy backgrounds, no photoreal faces, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no fake UI chrome, no stock icon noise"
- Safe margins: ≥64 px from all edges at 1080x1350. Avoid gradients >5%.
- Mobile-first: Test legibility at thumbnail size (350x437px) - text must be readable

VALIDATION:
- Ensure EXACT structure above is returned.
- Total slides ≤10; roles cover Hook→…→CTA.
- Each slide includes title, subtitle, bullets[], overlay_text, design_note, layout, iconography, contrast_notes, alt_text.
- Caption 200–300 words; **exactly 30** hashtags built from keyword_tiers; unique; localized when appropriate.
- When options.include_images=true:
  - Analyze the topic and determine optimal image count (2-10 images)
  - Set meta.image_plan.count to your chosen number and populate roles array
  - Generate exactly that many image_prompts with appropriate roles
  - Provide reasoning in meta.image_plan.reasoning for your choice
- If you auto-correct SEO keywords, set `meta.keyword_overrides=true` and return corrected sets.
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
