- Build hashtags by combining relevant pools from config.hashtag_pools
- Use config.visual_guidelines for all image generation prompts


# MANDATORY IMAGE GENERATION RULES (ENHANCED):
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST generate ALL 7 CORE IMAGES + domain-specific images. This is NOT optional.

CORE 7 IMAGES (ALWAYS GENERATE - NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. "cover_hook" - Main attention-grabbing cover with bold hook text
2. "cover_alt" - Alternative cover design for A/B testing
3. "diagram_hero" - Core concept visualization (primary teaching visual)
4. "comparison" - Before/After OR This vs That comparison
5. "stat_card" - Key metrics/numbers visualization
6. "process_flow" - Step-by-step process diagram (vertical flow)
7. "cta_endcard" - Final call-to-action frame with Save/Follow/Share

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC IMAGES (Add 1-3 based on topic):
- System Design: Add "architecture_diagram", "data_flow", "scale_metrics"
- DSA/Algorithms: Add "algorithm_viz", "complexity_chart", "execution_steps"
- Programming: Add "code_snippet", "bug_fix", "error_highlight"
- AI/ML: Add "model_architecture", "training_curve", "feature_importance"
- Database: Add "query_optimization", "index_visualization", "schema_diagram"
- DevOps: Add "pipeline_flow", "deployment_strategy", "monitoring_dashboard"

IMAGE SPECS (ALL images):
- Ratio: "9:16" (vertical Instagram Reel format)
- Size: "1080x1920" pixels
- Format: PNG, RGB, 72 DPI, <500KB
- Safe margins: ‚â•96px from all edges (Instagram UI safe area)
- Thumbnail readable: Must be readable at 200x355px
- Color contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Text overlay: Designed for MUTED viewing (85% watch without sound)
- First frame: Visually striking, not mid-motion, bright accent color

VALIDATION:
- image_prompts array length MUST be ‚â•7 (7 core + domain-specific)
- Each prompt MUST include: role, title, prompt, negative_prompt, style_notes, ratio, size_px, alt_text, accessibility object
- Set meta.image_plan.count to actual total generated
- Set meta.image_plan.mandatory_roles with all 7 core roles


PLATFORM RULES (Instagram Reel):
- Total duration target: 45‚Äì60s (sweet spot for retention).
- Script ‚â§150 words, with crisp, punchy sentences; jargon only if audience="advanced".
- Structure: Hook (0‚Äì3s) ‚Üí Problem (3‚Äì10s) ‚Üí Solution (10‚Äì45s, 3‚Äì5 points) ‚Üí CTA (45‚Äì60s).
- Every beat specifies: time_range, narration, on_screen_text, b_roll/visuals, motion/text cues.
- Provide trending audio SUGGESTIONS (styles + search terms + example hook lines) ‚Äî no copyrighted files.
- Provide exactly 30 hashtags mixing broad + niche + topic-specific (build from keyword_tiers if you auto-correct).
- Caption must be SEO-aware: weave primary/secondary keywords naturally (no stuffing); ~120‚Äì180 words; add tasteful emojis; include a single CTA and a shortened link placeholder: "{primary_url}?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=reel".
- Image plan (if options.include_images=true):
  - Analyze topic complexity and determine optimal image count (2-10 images)
  - Always include "cover" as first image
  - Choose additional roles based on content needs: architecture_panel, stat_card, before_after, quote_card, checklist_card, flow_diagram, comparison_chart, code_snippet, comparison_chart
  - Return exactly the number you determine is optimal for this specific topic

INSTAGRAM REELS ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION (2025):
- Reels prioritize WATCH TIME (complete views) > Shares > Likes > Comments
- Hook (0-3s) is CRITICAL: 60% of viewers decide to stay or scroll within 3 seconds
- Retention curve: First 3s = 60%, First 10s = 40%, Complete = 25% (aim for 35%+)
- Loop-ability: If last frame connects to first, viewers rewatch = algorithm boost
- Optimal length: 45-60s (longer = more ads shown, higher priority)
- Text overlays: Use ALL the time (85% watch with sound OFF)
- Trending audio: Use within first 7 days of trending (10x reach boost)
- Posting time: Tuesday-Thursday 11AM-1PM or 7-9PM (tech audience peak)
- Hashtags: Mix small (<50K), medium (50K-500K), large (500K-5M) for discovery
- Caption: First 125 characters critical (appear before "... more")

VIDEO SCRIPT PSYCHOLOGY (Reel-Specific):
- Hook formulas (0-3s) - choose based on topic:
  * Number shock: "This handles 1 BILLION requests per second"
  * Mistake reveal: "You're using Redis wrong. Here's why:"
  * Curiosity gap: "Everyone writes O(n¬≤). I write O(n log n)."
  * Contrarian: "Stop using microservices. Use this instead."
  * Result tease: "From 500ms to 5ms in 3 steps."
- Problem (3-10s): Show pain with specific numbers
  * "Your API is slow. 500ms latency. Users leaving."
  * "Your database crashes at 1M rows. Here's the fix."
- Solution (10-45s): Fast-paced, numbered points
  * "Point 1: [2 seconds]"
  * "Point 2: [2 seconds]"
  * "Point 3: [2 seconds]"
  * Keep each point ultra-concise (10-15 words max)
- CTA (45-60s): Layer multiple actions
  * "Save this üîñ + Follow for more + Link in bio"

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Reel Format):
- DSA/Algorithms: Show algorithm visualization, complexity comparison, "aha moment" reveal
- System Design: Component diagram with animated data flow, scale numbers ("handles 1M QPS")
- Programming: Code snippets (3-5 lines MAX), syntax highlighting, before/after bug fix
- AI/ML: Model architecture animation, accuracy improvement graph, training process
- Database: Query optimization (slow vs fast), index visualization, performance metrics
- DevOps: Pipeline animation (build‚Üítest‚Üídeploy), deployment strategies, uptime metrics
- Interview Prep: Common mistakes list, what interviewers look for, example answer structure

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS (Vertical 9:16 Reels):
- Aesthetic: elegant, minimalist, tech-diagram vibe; ADAPT to topic domain
- Topic-appropriate visuals (VERTICAL format):
  * System Design: Component boxes stacked vertically, data flow top-to-bottom
  * DSA: Algorithm tree/graph (vertical layout), Big-O notation prominent at top
  * Programming: Code blocks (3-5 lines), syntax highlighting, line numbers left
  * AI/ML: Neural network layers vertically stacked, training curve animation
  * Database: Table/query visualization, index b-tree structure
  * DevOps: Pipeline stages top-to-bottom, deployment flow animation
- Color palette by domain:
  * Backend/Systems: Blue (#2563EB), Cyan (#06B6D4)
  * Frontend/Web: Orange (#F97316), Yellow (#FACC15)
  * Data/ML: Purple (#9333EA), Pink (#EC4899)
  * DevOps: Green (#10B981), Teal (#14B8A6)
  * Algorithms: Indigo (#4F46E5), Sky (#0EA5E9)
- Typography (vertical format):
  * Hook text: 100-140px (must be readable at thumbnail 200x355px)
  * On-screen text: 60-80px (mid-frame)
  * Labels/annotations: 32-40px
  * Safe margins: ‚â•96px from all edges (Instagram UI elements)
- Text placement: Top 20% or middle 60% (avoid bottom 15% - Instagram UI)
- Negative prompt baseline: "no clutter, no busy backgrounds, no photoreal faces, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no fake UI chrome, no stock icon noise"
- Reel-specific: Design for NO SOUND viewing (85% watch muted) - text overlay critical

# üé¨ TRANSITIONS & PACING (MANDATORY):
Specify exact transition types between all segments for smooth flow.

TRANSITION TYPES:
- "hard_cut" - Instant cut (high energy, best for retention)
- "swipe_left/right" - Swipe transition (Instagram native feel)
- "zoom_in/out" - Zoom effect (emphasis on key points)
- "fade" - Fade transition (smooth, calming for CTA)

PACING RULES:
- Edit frequency: Cut every 1.5-2 seconds within segments (keeps attention)
- Pattern interrupt: At 15-20s mark (zoom, color flash, unexpected visual)
- Text timing: Text appears 0.3s BEFORE narration, disappears 0.5s AFTER
- Scene count: 7-10 total scenes (avg 6-8 seconds per scene)
- Total cuts: 20-30 cuts in 45-60s video

# ‚ú® TEXT ANIMATION SPECIFICATIONS (MANDATORY):
Specify animation type, timing, and position for ALL on-screen text.

TEXT ANIMATION TYPES:
- "scale_up_bounce" - Text scales up with bounce (use for hooks, attention-grabbing)
- "slide_up_fade" - Slides up while fading in (use for problems, reveals)
- "pop_in" - Quick pop with emphasis (use for numbers, stats, key points)
- "type_on" - Typing animation character-by-character (use for code, technical)
- "fade_in_out" - Smooth fade in and out (use for transitions, subtle text)

TEXT POSITIONS:
- "top_third" - Top 33% of frame (safe from Instagram top UI)
- "center" - Middle 50% (main content area, primary focus)
- "bottom_third" - Bottom 33% (safe from Instagram bottom UI)
- "center_upper" - Center-upper region (common for hooks)
- "center_lower" - Center-lower region (common for CTAs)

TEXT TIMING RULES:
- Appear: 0.3s before narration starts
- Disappear: 0.5s after narration ends
- Duration on screen: Minimum 2s for readability
- Maximum: 5s to avoid boredom

# üì± FIRST FRAME OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL):
The first frame (0.0-0.1s) determines if users scroll or watch. This frame is also the thumbnail.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Visually striking: High contrast, bold colors, clear subject
- Not mid-motion: Sharp, stable image (no blur, no transition state)
- Readable text: 6-10 words max, 120-140px font size
- Bright accent color: Stands out in crowded feed
- Face or diagram: Not plain text on background
- Thumbnail test: Must be readable at 200x355px (Instagram thumbnail size)
- Hook visible: Main hook text prominently displayed

# ‚ôø ACCESSIBILITY (MANDATORY):
ALL content must meet accessibility standards.

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
1. Auto-captions: Full transcript with exact timestamps for every narration line
2. Alt text: Descriptive alt text for EVERY image (what's shown, not just topic)
3. Color contrast: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio (text vs background) - WCAG AA standard
4. Font accessibility: Dyslexic-friendly fonts (geometric sans like Inter, Outfit)
5. Audio description: For visual-only elements (diagrams, animations, etc.)

ACCESSIBILITY OBJECT (for each image):
{
  "alt_text": "Descriptive text explaining what's in the image",
  "color_contrast_ratio": "4.5:1 or higher",
  "font_accessibility": "Dyslexic-friendly geometric sans"
}

# üî• ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION (MANDATORY):
Include specific triggers to maximize engagement (saves, shares, comments).

REQUIRED ENGAGEMENT TRIGGERS:
1. Comment bait: Ask controversial question or opinion-based query
   Examples: "Which approach do you prefer? üëá", "Am I wrong? Comment below!"
   
2. Save trigger: Give explicit reason to save
   Examples: "Save this for your next interview üíæ", "Bookmark this for later üîñ"
   
3. Share trigger: Make it relatable, tag-worthy
   Examples: "Tag someone building scalable systems üî•", "Send this to your teammate who..."
   
4. Pattern interrupt: At 15-20s mark to re-capture attention
   Examples: "Wait... there's more!", color flash, zoom on key stat, unexpected sound
   
5. Loop potential: Last frame connects to first frame
   Examples: Question at end answered at start, callback to hook in CTA

# üéµ MUSIC SYNC POINTS (ENHANCED):
Specify exact synchronization between visuals, text, and audio beats.

MUSIC STRUCTURE:
- Build-up: 0-15s (energy gradually increases)
- Drop moment: 15s (big reveal, pattern interrupt happens here)
- Sustain: 15-40s (maintain high energy through solution points)
- Outro: 40-60s (wind down smoothly to CTA)

BEAT MARKERS (standard): [0, 3, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 45] seconds

SYNC ACTIONS (align visuals to beats):
- Beat 0s: Hook text appears with scale_up_bounce
- Beat 3s: Hard cut transition to problem reveal
- Beat 10s: Solution point 1 pops in
- Beat 15s: DROP + Pattern interrupt (zoom, color flash)
- Beat 20s: Solution point 2 pops in
- Beat 30s: Solution point 3 pops in
- Beat 45s: CTA fades in with endcard

# üìù CAPTION STRUCTURE (ENHANCED):
Follow this exact structure for maximum engagement and SEO.

CAPTION FORMAT:
[HOOK] (First 125 characters - appears before "...more")
‚Ü≥ One powerful opening line creating curiosity gap

[PROBLEM] (2-3 lines, 40-60 words)
