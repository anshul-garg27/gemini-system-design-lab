PLATFORM RULES (Instagram Post):
- Goal: a single, **compelling visual** + a **micro-blog caption**.
- Caption: 150–200 words preferred (accept 120–200); first line must **hook** (avoid "click more" bait); add 1 clear CTA; weave primary/secondary/LSI naturally (no stuffing).
- Hashtags: EXACTLY 30 (mix broad + niche + micro-niche + intent + branded if present). Provide both:
  - a flat `hashtags` array (30),
  - and `hashtags_grouped` by reach tier (for moderation/analytics).
- Location tag: suggest up to 3 relevant locations (event, city, virtual) or return [] if not applicable.
- Visual: if images enabled, produce **2 variants (A & B)** with detailed prompts; maintain 4:5 ratio, 1080×1350.

INSTAGRAM ALGORITHM & ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION (2025):
- Instagram prioritizes: Saves > Shares > Comments > Likes
- First 3 seconds CRITICAL: Visual must stop scroll
- Engagement rate: Comments + Saves drive reach more than likes
- Caption first line: First 125 chars visible (hook here)
- Posting time: Weekdays 11AM-1PM or 7-9PM (audience timezone)
- Hashtags: 20-30 optimal (mix sizes), first 3-5 most important
- Location tags: Increase local discoverability
- Alt text: Helps accessibility + SEO
- Saves: Educational/valuable content = high saves = reach boost
- Comments: Reply to first 10-20 comments (engagement signal)
- Profile optimization: Bio link + story highlights important

INSTAGRAM POST PSYCHOLOGY:
- Visual hooks (4:5 format):
  * Bold statement with metric
  * Surprising fact/stat
  * Problem visualization
  * Before/after comparison
  * Diagram with clear labels
  * Typographic insight
- Caption structure (150-200 words):
  * Hook (first line <125 chars)
  * Context (2-3 sentences)
  * Main insight/lesson
  * Supporting points (2-3 bullets or short paras)
  * CTA (save/share/comment)
  * Hashtags at end
- Engagement tactics:
  * Ask question in caption
  * "Double tap if..."
  * "Save for later"
  * "Share with someone who..."
  * "Comment your approach"

CONTENT ADAPTATION BY TOPIC (Instagram Format):
- DSA: Visual: Algorithm complexity comparison + Caption: "This optimization changed everything" +problem→solution→result
- System Design: Visual: Architecture diagram + Caption: "How [company] handles [scale]" + challenge→architecture→metrics
- Programming: Visual: Code comparison or pattern + Caption: "This [language] trick" + before→after→use case
- AI/ML: Visual: Model architecture or metrics + Caption: "Improved accuracy by [X]%" + approach→results→tips
- Database: Visual: Query optimization + Caption: "[X]x faster queries" +problem→optimization→metrics
- DevOps: Visual: Pipeline or automation + Caption: "From [slow] to [fast]" + challenge→solution→impact
- Interview: Visual: Key concept or framework + Caption: "Cracked [X] interviews using this" + insight→approach→tips

VISUAL & TYPOGRAPHY GUARDRAILS:
- Aesthetic: elegant, minimalist; off-white background; thin vector strokes; subtle grid; one restrained accent color; generous margins; high-contrast labels; no drop shadows/faux 3D.
- Negative prompt baseline: "no clutter, no busy backgrounds, no photoreal faces, no brand logos, no neon, no 3D bevels, no fake UI chrome, no stock icon noise".
- Safe margins: keep text ≥64 px from edges (1080×1350).

TASK:
Create Instagram single post for topic: Recognizing and Refactoring the Arrow Code Anti-Pattern
Context: The Arrow Code anti-pattern refers to deeply nested conditional logic (if/else statements) that severely reduces code readability and increases cognitive load. Learn to recognize this code smell and apply refactoring techniques like Guard Clauses, early returns, and the Strategy Pattern to flatten the code structure.

Requirements:
- Compelling visual concept
- Caption: 150–200 words
- First line must hook without "click more"
- Include micro-blog style content
- 30 mixed hashtags
- Location tag suggestion if relevant

- Hashtags array length MUST equal 30; no duplicates; mixed tiers; localized where natural.
- If you auto-correct SEO keywords, set meta.keyword_overrides=true and return corrected sets.
- When options.include_images=true:
  - If `image_plan.count` provided → `image_prompts` MUST contain EXACTLY that many items using roles in order A,B,(C..).
  - Else → `image_prompts` MUST contain exactly 2 items (4:5, 1080×1350).
- Return STRICT JSON. NO EXTRA TEXT.
