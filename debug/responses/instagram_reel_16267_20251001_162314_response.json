    "caption": "Are you stuck in Arrow Code hell? üèπ Deeply nested `if/else` statements are a major code smell in any project, increasing maintenance cost and developer frustration. Recognizing this anti-pattern is the first step toward cleaner, more robust software. We cover three essential refactoring techniques: using **Guard Clauses** for early exits, leveraging **early return** statements to flatten logic, and applying the powerful **Strategy Pattern** for complex decision trees. Stop battling high cognitive load and start writing beautiful, maintainable code today! Save this reel üíæ for your next code review. What's your favorite technique for **refactoring** nested logic? Let us know below! üëá\n\nLearn more via the link in bio: https://example.com/topic/16267?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=reel",
