    "caption": "When designing high-scale APIs, effective **rate limiting** is non-negotiable. ðŸ›‘ While the Token Bucket algorithm allows for bursts, the **Leaky Bucket algorithm** is the ultimate tool for **traffic shaping** and guaranteeing a strictly constant output rate. \n\nThis is crucial in **distributed systems** where preventing downstream service flooding is vital for overall **API performance** and stability. Think of it as stabilizing the water flow, no matter how much water you pour in! Mastering the trade-offs between these two approaches is key for any serious **system design** interview. \n\nWhich rate limiter do you prefer?
