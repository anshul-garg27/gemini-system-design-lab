](LICENSE)\n\nThis repository provides a hands-on example of how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) transforms system deployment by treating infrastructure configurations like software. It demonstrates how to provision, modify, and version a cloud environment repeatably and reliably using a single command.\n\n- **Docs**: [GitHub Pages Site](./docs/index.md)\n- **Further reading**: [Discover how IaC transforms system deployment](https://example.com/topic/1727?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo)\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n- [Architecture](#architecture)\n- [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n\n## Features\n- **Declarative Provisioning**: Define the desired state of your infrastructure in code.\n- **Version-Controlled**: Manage infrastructure changes through Git, enabling pull requests, reviews, and history.\n- **Repeatable & Consistent**: Eliminate configuration drift by creating identical environments from the same codebase.\n- **Automated Workflow**: Integrates with CI/CD to automatically apply infrastructure changes.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/systemdesign/iac-one-command-deploy.git\ncd iac-one-command-deploy\n\n# 2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# 3. Configure your cloud provider credentials (e.g., for AWS)\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"YOUR_KEY\"\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"YOUR_SECRET\"\nexport AWS_REGION=\"us-east-1\"\n```\n\n## Usage\nThis example uses a Python script to orchestrate the deployment. The underlying IaC tool (like Terraform or Pulumi) is abstracted away.\n\n```python\n# main.py - A simplified example of an IaC deployment script\n\nfrom src.deploy import provisioner\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Defines and deploys the infrastructure stack.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Initializing infrastructure deployment...\")\n\n    # Define the desired state of the infrastructure\n    stack_config = {\n        \"project_name\": \"web-app-prod\",\n        \"components\": {\n            \"vpc\": { \"cidr_block\": \"10.0.0.0/16\" },\n            \"server\": { \"instance_type\": \"t3.micro\" },\n            \"database\": { \"engine\": \"postgres\", \"size\": \"small\" }\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Run the deployment command\n    result = provisioner.apply(stack_config)\n\n    if result.success:\n        print(\"\\nDeployment successful!\")\n        print(f\"Outputs: {result.outputs}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nDeployment failed: {result.error}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\nTo run the deployment:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n## Configuration\nConfiguration is managed through environment variables.\n\n| Name                  | Type   | Default     | Description                                       |\n|-----------------------|--------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `CLOUD_PROVIDER`      | string | `\"aws\"`     | The cloud provider to target (e.g., 'aws', 'gcp').  |\n| `AWS_REGION`          | string | `\"us-east-1\"` | The AWS region for resource deployment.           |\n| `TF_STATE_BACKEND`    | string | `\"s3\"`      | The backend for storing Terraform state (`s3`, `local`). |\n| `PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` | string | `\"staging\"` | The deployment environment (e.g., 'staging', 'prod'). |\n\n## Architecture\nThe core workflow for an IaC deployment is triggered by a code change and executed by an automation pipeline.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Developer writes/updates IaC code] --> B{Git Push};\n    B --> C[CI/CD Pipeline Triggered];\n    C --> D[1. Plan: IaC tool previews changes];\n    D --> E{Manual Approval?};\n    E -- Yes --> F[2. Apply: IaC tool provisions resources];\n    E -- No --> G[End];\n    F --> H[Cloud Infrastructure Updated];\n```\n_Alt text_: A flowchart showing the IaC workflow: a developer pushes code, which triggers a CI/CD pipeline that runs a plan and apply stage to update cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Roadmap\n- [ ] Add support for another cloud provider (GCP/Azure).\n- [ ] Implement a secrets management example (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).\n- [ ] Create a more complex example with networking and load balancing.\n- [ ] Add automated infrastructure testing.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome!

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## FAQ\n**Q:** What is the difference between declarative and imperative IaC?\n**A:** Declarative IaC focuses on the *what*—you define the desired end state, and the tool figures out how to get there (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi). Imperative IaC focuses on the *how*—you write scripts that execute a sequence of commands to create infrastructure (e.g., AWS CLI scripts).\n\n**Q:** Why is version control essential for infrastructure?\n**A:** It provides an auditable history of all changes, enables collaboration through pull requests, allows for rollbacks to previous known-good states, and serves as the single source of truth for your infrastructure's configuration.\n",

      "body": "### Context\nThis repository demonstrates a basic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup for deploying a system with a single command. It covers the core concepts of declarative configuration and version-controlled infrastructure.\n\n### What I'm sharing\n- A runnable example of an IaC deployment script (see `main.py`).\n- A Mermaid diagram in the README illustrating the CI/CD workflow for IaC.\n\n### What I'd love feedback on\nI've kept this example simple, but production systems have more complex needs. I'm curious how others would evolve this project.\n\n1.  **State Management**: The current setup implies local state. How would you configure remote state management (e.g., Terraform Cloud, S3 backend) for a team? What are the key security considerations?\n2.  **Secrets Handling**: The example avoids secrets. What's your preferred pattern for injecting secrets (e.g., database passwords, API keys) into an IaC configuration? (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, encrypted files).\n3.  **Modularity**: How would you break this monolithic stack into reusable modules for different environments (staging vs. production)?\n\n### Stack\n- **Language**: Python\n- **IaC Tool (conceptual)**: Terraform, Pulumi, or similar.\n- **Cloud**: AWS (conceptual)\n\n### Known limitations\n- This is not production-ready.\n- Lacks error handling, secrets management, and robust state locking.\n\n### Links\n- [Repository README](https://github.com/systemdesign/iac-one-command-deploy)\n- [Deep-dive on IaC Principles](https://example.com/topic/1727?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo)",
