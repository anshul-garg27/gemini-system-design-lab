    "extended_post": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a mindset shift. It falls into two main approaches:\n\n🔹 **Declarative (The \"What\"):** You define the desired end state (e.g., \"I need 5 servers with this config\"), and the IaC tool figures out how to achieve it. Think Terraform or CloudFormation.\n\n🔸 **Imperative (The \"How\"):** You write explicit, step-by-step commands to reach the end state. Think shell scripts or Ansible.\n\nBy using version control (like Git), every change is tracked, reviewed, and auditable.",
