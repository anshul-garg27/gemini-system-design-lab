# ✅ Instagram Carousel Prompt - FULLY ENHANCED

## 🎉 Summary

Instagram Carousel prompt has been **completely enhanced** to match the quality and comprehensiveness of the Instagram Reel prompt!

---

## ✨ What Was Added

### 1. **🎯 Swipe Completion System**
- **swipe_trigger** field added to each slide (slides 1-8)
- Psychological triggers to drive swipe completion:
  - Slide 1: "But there's a catch..." → drives to slide 2
  - Slide 2: "But there's a way out... swipe →" → drives to slide 3
  - Slide 3-8: Progressive curiosity gaps → keeps swiping
  - Slide 9-10: Final CTA, no swipe needed

**Example:**
```json
"swipe_trigger": "'But what about trade-offs?' or 'See the comparison →'"
```

---

### 2. **♿ Accessibility (WCAG AA) - MANDATORY**

#### Added to Meta:
```json
"accessibility": {
  "compliance_level": "WCAG AA",
  "features": [
    "All text contrast 4.5:1 minimum (7:1 for headlines)",
    "Alt text for every slide (≤160 chars)",
    "Dyslexic-friendly fonts (Outfit, Inter, DM Sans)",
    "Readable at thumbnail size (350x437px)",
    "No reliance on color alone for information"
  ],
  "slide_alt_texts_provided": true,
  "contrast_validated": true
}
```

#### Added to Each Slide:

  "alt_text": "Descriptive text for screen readers (≤160 chars)",
  "color_contrast_ratio": "4.5:1 minimum (7:1 for headlines)",
