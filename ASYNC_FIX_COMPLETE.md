# ✅ Async Methods Fixed!

## Error Resolved: `object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression`

### Problem:
Methods were being called with `await` but weren't defined as `async`:
```python
await self.db.save_result(...)  # ❌ Error!
```

### Solution:
Made all content generation database methods async:

```python
# BEFORE:
@db_operation()
def save_result(self, cursor, ...):

# AFTER:
@db_operation()
async def save_result(self, cursor, ...):
```

## ✅ Methods Fixed (6 total):

1. ✅ `async def create_job()` - Create content generation job
2. ✅ `async def update_job_status()` - Update job status
3. ✅ `async def create_task()` - Create task
4. ✅ `async def update_task_status()` - Update task status
5. ✅ `async def save_result()` - Save generation result
6. ✅ `async def save_prompt()` - Save prompt
